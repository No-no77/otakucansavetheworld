Similar to Gwern's apprioach to Confidence and Importance tags, I will be using the following methodology to organize my posts:

**certainty:**

likely - It is likely that my ideas are correct
high -  It is high likely that my ideas are correct
log - A mere register of a sequence of facts, preferably in  chronological order.

It's important to notice that other than log, the certainty tags for other posts are subjected to change as time goes.

**importance:**

It ranges from 1 to 5 based on what I think is the common sense. Additionally, the value *autism* represents topics that I find of great importance, but that would rank low to the average person.

**status:** 

unfinished - The post is unfinished.
complete - The post is complete.
eternal - Posts that will only stop when I give up on them or die.
