## Google Search Tips

A few notes from Gwern's "Internet Search Tips"

1. Double quotes for exact matches
2. Hyphens for negation/exclusion
3. Site: for search a specific website or specific directory of that website (eg. site:gwern.net/docs/genetics/, or to exclude folders, site:gwern.net -site:gwern.net/docs/).
4. Tools > Set date range
5. Tools > Verbatim mode
