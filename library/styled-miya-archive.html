</head><body><div>Hypergamy is not the problem, in truth, it is eugenic under polygyny. Monogamy without arranged marriage provides the platform for dysgenic hypergamy, the platform is anti-natalist free sexuality. And yet, Abraham arranged the marriage of his son, as God arranged Adam and Eve.</div>
    <div>Tbh they not wrong about eurocentrism, cultural imperialism, even pomo relativity. Except its not simply \"white\" &amp; Other, but hyperethnic Others on Others, that every each intellectual \"school\" is actually an ethnic clade, all experience is relative to ethnicity, not individual.</div>
    <div>The reason this won't be implemented in Western Democracy despite respect for the free hand market, is because of a refusal to accept the subsumption of the individual into scale heuristics. But itll happen anyway, the efficiency opportunity cost of AI's scrying truth is too high</div>
    <div>All incentives can be bought with money. Simply raise the cost of stealing for those more motivated to do so to better discourage it. This is why the wealthy get lenience w the law, by the way; its not just because \"privilege\", but their damage to society at scale is simply less.</div>
    <div>This isn't the same conception as Minority Report's AI simulation used to predict crimes before they occur; used more as an augmentation of preventative policing, whose ethical dilemma is really a concern on entrapment, though more of a self-entrapment if you think about it...</div>
    <div>AI judicialism would have predictive crime metrics substitute for due process. If someone has increased likelihood of committing a crime, he would be punished accordingly in such a way as to equally disincentivize the crime; or possibly, the fines threatened scaled accordingly.</div>
    <div>I now understand the point of modern dating is to collect broken hearts</div>
    <div>a hunt for the heart of saturday night, a hunt for a virgin kill, fiends for a hookup, a heart to crush, a pill to take. I now understand the meaning of an \"emotional hurricane\", its the social scene itself, dive in and wreck a terror; #metoo has ruined it all with consequences.</div>
    <div>There is an irresistibly baroque charm to elite urban hedonism, you have to love the raucous night out; the dress up and tear downs, backseat mascara, drunken flurry spill out onto streets, a dangerous after, illegal party favors gone wrong, tear stained mascara. its all a hunt.</div>
    <div>\"Shut down entire economy\" response to corona pandemic is so lol, costs far more lives than saved. Let cities get cleansed, streets emptied, but the economy must go on. Businesses \"do their part to stop the spread\" by hemorrhaging working capital is Woke Capital's final deathblow</div>
    <div>It takes 5 hours to learn to fish, not 5 years. 5 days to make your first wood chair, 5 weeks to master aim with a gun, 5 months to build a permaculture. Urbanites vlog building their first homestead cabins in 30 days, and pasty nerds will tell u \"actually that makes u a target\"</div>
    <div>Bitter cope against their betters masked their crippling high time preference. This is the idiot tax shredding the lower classes as the financiers get their stocks wrecked</div>
    <div>Coronavirus' real consequence has nothing to do with lives, but economic isolationism. The 3% human capital shred's NOTHING compared to wealth destroyed in corona's aggressively immediate antiglobalism, u must understand this; and this is where the real blood will pile up, anyway</div>
    <div>We are on the precipice of an extreme financial crash &amp; global supply chain collapse &amp; y'all are busy countersignalling panic preppers for buying toilet paper. A world order reversal like this happens once an era, I don't think u understand the amount of wealth upheaval occurring</div>
    <div>Miya's reminder: price gouging is the most efficient &amp; most accurate way low supply high demand necessities are given to those who genuinely, truly \"need it most\"; especially when only alternative sorting algorithms are literally equal rations, or at best \"first come first serve\"</div>
    <div>Imagine thinking you need 3 meals per person per day, or stocking up on neosporin medical kit, not simply cloves and vodka.</div>
    <div>It is too late to stock up on canned goods. Last minute shopping guide, I recommend you stock up on water, beans, refined coconut oil, raw acv and salt; buy bulk fruits and learn to can them, get chickens for eggs and grow potatos, they're easy to learn. And learn to fast, lol</div>
    <div>Dm's asking for prep advice. Major essentials are some kind of cooker, a coop and chicks for eggs, herb garden and semi perma vegetable, berry &amp; nut tree garden. water, rice, beans. bulk coconut oil, honey, canning salt, canned meat (yoder's brand), canned fruit, + raw acv, vodka</div>
    <div>We have far further to fall. If you think toilet paper is bad, wait until you see real supply chain collapse. There will be blood in the streets.</div>
    <div>Quercetin is for curing respiratory viruses, eg coronavirus, btw, not a daily supplement. Everything else on this list though is GOAT, you can’t go wrong with this stack.</div>
    <div>I really do consider individuals like these to be supremely important online entities, something not much short of a digital diety, worthy of sanctification. I knew a few in my time before twitter, legendary high functioning schizophrenics, likely munchausen’d. This is the power</div>
    <div>The tide of globalism will recede, as it has so many times before. but we're this time against the clock; biovirus-induced localism against capitalist AI ascension. it takes only one dedicated silicon nerd &amp; his army of pajeets, after all. The contemporary Ted K praxis is clear.</div>
    <div>a rule of nutritionism that for every good nutrient, there must be a bad nutrient to serve as its foil, the latter a focus for our food fears and the former for our enthusiasms.</div>
    <div>Did there even exist meaningful political division as a facet of \"ideology\" memetic infection (not either stark power or race-as-religion) before the French invented the human equality meme or is it not at all consequences of that departure from reality, a virtuality one enters</div>
    <div>Properly pursued, the only real financial risk associated with childrearing as investment is the possibility of a daughter.</div>
    <div>People think kids are a waste of money to raise and that college is investment. They got it backwards. College is a money shredder but kids are cheap investments with high ROI, very profitable - if you keep them in the home, assign them to a trade, pool the collective income.</div>
    <div>White working class financial splendour isn't hard, and the answer IS trades. What people don't understand is is true financial utopia, that stable median of convenient luxury of the middle class at its peak, is the MULTI-generational trade: its the trade as family company.</div>
    <div>Atheist christians be like \"asians eat gross!!\" between routine bites burnt factory meat fed on soy and pasteurized cheeses fed on soy and baked wheat and think it's good because they drench it in artificial sweetener sauces, their limp dicks shriveling under the table. Forgotten</div>
    <div>But history returns so easily, so suddenly, like lightning tearing through a veil: struck by a sun-tarred aquiline nose, the skinny, sunken, black eyes of a redskinned Azteca gas attendant, spied from behind my locked car window.</div>
    <div>Sometimes drifting in the deepest urban heart, asphalt and pavement for 20mi every direction with only lawn grass to break it up, clear blue skies and beautiful clouds, I can try and lose myself in modernism's illusion, the dome home, top-down full human artifice, perfection.</div>
    <div>This is a serious question. I know there are many little local groups, but are there any national environmental charities that are true both in heart and action?</div>
    <div>What are the good charities? Medical charities are categorically invalidated by modern medicine's anti-hippocraticism; unless its medical terrorism. Economic charities are too bc subsidization is incentivization. Good charities are only green, for plants &amp; animals. What are they?</div>
    <div>Hope corona gets all SEA 2hu posters, they're the worst...</div>
    <div>Tort reform debate, however, is frivolous. A truly efficient consumer litigation process would crash healthcare; they say 50% of a doctor's time is already spent dealing with malpractice litigation, but it would justly be 100%. Think about it.</div>
    <div>Rumor has it if you pass the sickness onto another, it leaves you. Something to consider...</div>
    <div>If you meet any \"cinephile\" who uses Michael Bay as a foil of blockbuster studio dregs against the auteur, against artistic merit, against his self fashioned auteurism of taste—kill him. Paul W. S. Anderson has produced more depth of cinema than Paul or Wes Anderson combined.</div>
    <div>Auteur theory in modern film crit is so bunk; just mean the directors identifiable, rarity in age of the studio movie, standard today - superhero directors are named auteurs. Now used as label of quality, \"are videogames art?\": Is Bay an auteur? Of cours, most of anyone this gen.</div>
    <div>All things flow from nutrition, you must understand this. Everything you need to know is already inside, in your blood, king, you just need unclog your arteries.</div>
    <div>I've a favorite brand of industrially manufactured glassware, not some boutique shit, its well-made but I can reliably re-order &amp; stock entire kitchens with, a personal cult classic, if you will (entire category is by definition cult). You guessed it, it's schott zweisel tritan</div>
    <div>Mind of the mountain man is astonishing to the modern urbanite, depth of memory he holds for his local ecology, deep knowledge of their every interaction. Great intuitive learning that would take 20 volumes to ever put to writing; when avg smoothbrains could barely fill 50 pages.</div>
    <div>Frustate wordlets run up against wall of my fairly high IQ posting convinced I comb over posts with thesauraus but Im only delete grammar, dismantle syntax &amp; etymologically converge in esoteric pursuit of abbo TRVE language, sekrets in ESL...or perhaps 0 char FUCK an oxford comma</div>
    <div>Its true, I do run around, esp car -&gt; building. I also tweet from the highway, eat standing, do stretches and little dancing jigs while waiting in line, look through people in conversations, print out internet pics I like and tape them on my wall, and stash liquor in my glove box</div>
    <div>tf even happened to nyx did I just swallow her whole or what</div>
    <div>its been so long I paid attention to acctwit i cant remember if im subtweeting a specific person or an assemblage in my head of their combined cringe</div>
    <div>Imagine unironically generating photography in 2020, let alone playing in a drums and guitar band, in 2020, and thinking you're future lmfao just because you listen to synthwave (LOL) when you theorycel LOL</div>
    <div>26yr old tranners really be out there shilling blogs, photography \"art\", graphic tees, self-doxx to share unironic band, their \"talks\" (lol); call themselves \"accelerationists\". only thing they accelr8ing is distance from the lucid virtual zeitgeist found only in anonymity...ngmi</div>
    <div>there is only one brand of acc left and its miya stan</div>
    <div>Forget about privacy meme, it's about what comes back, not what leaves, that's dangerous: any algorithm that returns feedback based on your input is subconsciously training you, incredibly dangerous manipulation, forging you zombie virus receptacle. Yes, twitter included.</div>
    <div>What non-\"private\" apps achieve is user tracking, and it is not the tracking that is pernicious but what they do with it-not sending it to the government, but using it for personalized feedback, for \"recommendation algorithms\". THIS is dangerous, this is training you, fear THIS.</div>
    <div>Your security is only found in compartmentalization; seek not \"privacy\" not \"anti-tracking\", but anti-compromisation, anti-deanonymization. Attempting to blanket yourself from surveillance is a forced meme to distract you from contingency planning from inevitable leaks.</div>
    <div>Midwits hate Alexa because they've been trained to cherish \"privacy\". The platitude is true, if you're not doing anything wrong, you've nothing to hide. It's true too, there is nothing one can do wrong; there are no Alexa arrests, no fruits of their snooping. \"Privacy\" is an op</div>
    <div>Alexa is lame you say? Not when you learn you can set her trigger word to \"computer\". Suddenly we are launched into the future of the 80s, you cannot deny it, you cannot cringe. Computer! Weather. Computer! Time. Computer! Play Vivaldi. Computer!</div>
    <div>I've outfitted my home with Alexa's, and I love it. Music rebounds where it never did before in fear of the mental abuse any impromptu \"bluetooth connection\" demands; and how the lights wake to greet me, and the ease with which I set alarms. That's all it can do, but it's enough.</div>
    <div>The fact that \"prepping\" is distinctly American-blooded pasttime proves her perennial superiority over the leftover continent; and make no mistake, there's little more American than an obtuse, unjustified certainty of fantastical apocalypse sated by industrial consumer collecting</div>
    <div>Funny how accurate, universal and intuitive using racial majority in ascending order of median IQ is as an indicator for poverty as an indicator for crime rate as a heuristic for walking alone at night female rape or male muggability index is in globalised urbanism</div>
    <div>Some consumerism transcends time. We all know mechanical watches descend forever, and of grandmother's furs. But did you know the Patagonia brand carries a no questions asked lifetime warranty? As long as it's not lost, they'll replace it. A curious lindy of the theseus stripe.</div>
    <div>Not that GG isn’t a GOAT soap, and NYC a dead city, but if you want to see a “true” depiction of da New York upper class on film, Whit Stillman’s Metropolitan &amp; Last Days of Disco, and also, the original Cloverfield (really), breathe it by heart.</div>
    <div>One is not allowed to show unfiltered Masterdom on mass media without the copes &amp; caveats of a noble poorman interjecting w slave morality propaganda; but at end of the day, Mastery allures, and all slaves wish to be it, they dream to be the beautiful &amp; wealthy caveats and all.</div>
    <div>Has it ever occurred to you just WHY all women's \"favorite books\" exist only on the \"YA Fiction\" plane? Yes, even the much-touted \"educated woman\" has yet to surpass the Young Adult ceiling, that mental developmental barrier, have U ever really stopped to think WHY that might be?</div>
    <div>They've factory produced hordes of hello world coders who can't hack a solution to a problem if their life depended on it, not without an enterprise project manager guiding them; and only if there's money, to recover glorified code camp degree investment</div>
    <div>Only 20 years in the past, if one had a computer need, they hacked the solution, then provided online for anyone else who might have same need. Now average user is entirely technically illiterate, so everyone just sits and waits until the benevolent corporation provides solution.</div>
    <div>Amazing how quickly DIY programming culture failed to a point where they now can't address the most widely demanded needs - just discovered there's no solution to sorting Amazon listings by price per unit rather than total price, though its entirely possible with Amazon's API.</div>
    <div>When I see an \"educated female\" I see a deep sinkhole, a blackhole of wealth burned to achieve absolutely nothing, or worse: education an indoctrination in further financially dysgenic ideology, plus sexual record to make her unmarriagable to any decent man. To \"invest\" in this!</div>
    <div>Perhaps the most pernicious myth of personal finance shredding is \"investing in female education\", in a daughter who leaves to enter another family with not even a dowry traded in return, who will never use her \"education\" for any actual career, or worse: might, and no children.</div>
    <div>Wikipedia recommendation algorithm, Wikipedia playlists, Wikipedia hypertext excerpt collage social network, Wiki 2.0... Actually, my favorite site on the internet, am proud to be \"Wikipedia educated\", my much bountiful springboard, connoisseur of the not-to-standards stub page.</div>
    <div>have mailed surplus masks &amp; safety glasses to concerned family, but it's water, canned food, bullets &amp; batteries you should be stocking. Ppl don't understand the reality of crisis until it's already here, its a drama to them; sunglasses are more protective than surgical masks.</div>
    <div>Coronavirus or something-like-it is the long overdue malthusian correction for high density, high interconnectivity globalism; but it's also a well-positioned kick off for the inflated keynesian world economy's long overdue collapse.</div>
    <div>You must understand this.</div>
    <div>Raised in a context of extreme wealth, I was lucky to have been a neglected child, a left to her own devices child. I was lucky to have been a reclusive child, a staring child. The higher the class, greater the depth of human experience experienced: the greatest, deepest abuses.</div>
    <div>To a normie, talking about Taiwanese new wave cinema or Mongolian politics is equally as obscure esotericism as ancient Atlantis or missing 411 or Vitamin K2, and the only delicacy U need to manage is their intellectual insecurity—they feel it’s threatening that you’re well read.</div>
    <div>The meme goes, the lemming masses only care about politics when it effects their bottom line. No, they don't ever care about politics, they care about their bottom line. Why would anyone ever care about politics?</div>
    <div>Lemming normie cares about their bottom line - their family, their job, their house. Being into politics at all is already extremism, it's already delusional. Get a little financial stability in them, they're open: politics is a pasttime, of course they like it interesting.</div>
    <div>An aside: the king meme as a misogyny normalizer is its most potent formulation. I will call you king when you post dms mogging women, tell them you want to crush their head between their palms and they reply \"thats hot\". This is the move.</div>
    <div>Yeah, it's just a silly meme; but nothing is just a meme, theyre powerful expressions of the collective noosphere.  kingposting communities prove themselves weak against the alternative, hard banter, where u call your friends cvnts &amp; strangers mates. Only one breeds strong horses</div>
    <div>Not that misogyny is problem; it's first step to the mannerbund. Kingposting just seems to contradict protocols of self-improvement, puts cart behind horse under presumption social approval can be proxy for self-confidence. It shares all the flaws \"yass queen\" was mocked for.</div>
    <div>Kingposting isn't exclusive to bodybuilder community. It's also popular with 30 yr old doomer ironybros and fornite zoomers, with identical use. What is shared is male domination: its encoded message is misogyny, not self-improvement.</div>
    <div>Allow me lil meme archaeology: kingposting originates in ironically paralleling female \"yass queen\" posting. It began to be used post-ironically as part of larger reclamation of male-to-male affection w/in dominately male online circles; unironic peer support, same as yass queen.</div>
    <div>I wish there were capitalism documentaries like there are nature documentaries, like How Stuff Works but instead of engineering, the many little machines of capitalism; appreciate its beauty, its perfect, organic design: the marvel of capitalism; the immaterial clade of ecology.</div>
    <div>Homosexuality is found in over 450 species. \n\nHomophobia is only found in one.\n\nWhich one seems unnatural now?\n\nRape is found in over 450 species.\n\nConsent is only found in one.\n\nWhich one seems unnatural now?\n\nThink about it.</div>
    <div>Yet not so for the tr&amp;nner! While their recent prominence and proliferation might only be an accident of progressing intersectionalism, their accidental radicalness has already thoroughly dismantled feminist gender theory and unraveled intersectionality. Just one push through...</div>
    <div>Bros will run in tears to their friends and try to tell me how \"everyone doesn't like you\" like we baby stacey's on the playground, call their mom &amp; I'm sitting buddha faced mog god. left stroke putting entire timeline in breakdown. It's time to ask: who really on pink pills?</div>
    <div>My detractors project HRT accusations when their low T &amp; feminized beta mannerisms put them on the accidental path of MTF transition. Yet I stand tall with twitter's most psychopath-grade emotional stuntedness, slyest aristocratic eye-smile &amp; the binocular clarity of a predator.</div>
    <div>Only time lying to call someone king for “confidence boost” is plausibly justified are the incel blackpills deeply crippled by delusion-grade insecurity. This is level of omega loser u become &amp; are forever kept at when u kingpost - peer gaslighting is only thing keeping u going.</div>
    <div>they’ll cry “b-b-b-but miya, it’s making up for Society keeping boys down!” Never take your advice from these eternal betas, they’re slaves in a bucket keeping you dragged down to their level. Hear me: Men have never needed social approval to be men. Virtue is a private endeavor.</div>
    <div>You must understand, women are facetious when they make displays of accepting their peer’s ugliness; it’s a strategy designed to neuter competition, keeping them complacent in weakness. Kingposting is identical malice: real bros call you a lil botch when you’re lacking, not king.</div>
    <div>If you want a vision of men dug into their own ditch, imagine “yasss king slay!!! 🤤 👑” posted under a lanklet getting mad online, forever.</div>
    <div>Reminder my DMs are always open for Q&amp;A. I may take awhile to respond but I do read all of it</div>
    <div>\"Weird\" twitterature, and all other pseudo-surrealism, shouldn't be consumed. Conditions you to empty signifiers, to ignore the dense word salad (digital’s one true form) as impressionistic gloss, not deep code. Tellingly, will be first of crass content effectively automated.</div>
    <div>This is the abbo esotericism embedded in Hakan’s reverse #transmogrification ideology</div>
    <div>The phrase \"it's just a tweet\" is such a weak mindset You are ok with the stagnant follower growth, bad tweets, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing time, youve lost twice. Theres always something to learn and always room for improvement, never settle</div>
    <div>TV? No thanks, boomer I only watch “Alexa youtube search vedic mystery ancient”</div>
    <div>Flipping on Yakub and Atlantis youtube videos on the smart TV  at the kickback is the same degree of “move” as putting sc mixtapes on the aux instead of spotify trap. It’s not that edgy, just a bit alt. It’s what Space Ghost: Coast to Coast and Sealab 2021 was in the 00s.</div>
    <div>Biggest conspiracy redpill is its inherently accessible to normies—when presented, not in regurgitation, but in video; not as revelation, but as entertainment (as it is); not in private, but socially, gathered at couch. “Mystery/conspiracy” is a tv genre, just badly researched.</div>
    <div>You must understand, all wisdom comes from within. There’s nothing to hear, nothing to read, that you can’t already know yourself—if only attuned. You must understand there is no barrier between body &amp; mind, as there is no barrier to the physical &amp; metaphysical. You must underst</div>
    <div>Conversely, you must understand it all begins with nutrition. There is no far right, no traditionalism, without a return to the true diet, and only from it will we discover virtuous action. Diet and politics are the strongest correlation - not IQ, not education, not geography.</div>
    <div>A nutrition can be right-wing—it’s true: eating meat &amp; fat is a politicized rejection of progressive world order’s “green” “ethical” diet—bc true nutrition leads to a true mind leads to true politics. It is the first step; a nutrition of slaves leads you to only into their yoke.</div>
    <div>Stfu Stacey have you even heard of the throat-nostril axis? I’m eating my boogers to cultivate my mouth biome, it’s not gross</div>
    <div>The topwit clade of any sphere can be further differentiated between dim/mid/topwit in parallel with the fractalized dilineation of the category itself; this is revealed to be the case because the topwit interpretation is its platonic expression.</div>
    <div>there literally isn't any non-enlightenment \"inalienable human rights poo poo pee pee\" argument against slavery</div>
    <div>Basically, u just have to trick the insecure lower IQ posters into shilling you by pretending to be dumber than them. Stealing all their worthwhile followers is a given; the people naturally want to stand with the strong horse. Thanks for the 6K nerds</div>
    <div>Lots of people who \"hate miya\", all you talking about me sekretly in group chats: I'm there, we're bros, we're old mutuals, I've always been there, I'm watching all of it, and you've told me everything already. Nothing here is real.</div>
    <div>I own 2 other 'mid clout' alts w 2K+ followers &amp; cuple more in 'baby clout' 0.6-1.2K range; they dont much interact w me, they in their own frogtwit networks, sum even my ostensible enemies. Thats just me, &amp; I'm new here, still getting hang of things. Nothing you see here is real</div>
    <div>Twitter end-game is getting fedded and turned into an informant/agent. The average poster here, and I mean the actual average, the swathe of nothing accounts, are bots; their opposite, at the peaks, everyone except for me, are zombie actors for arcane powers, living subversions.</div>
    <div>tbh there is something deeply amiss afoot with this whole thing, I keep getting strong fed signals in my gut, tho I can't see any rationale for it, BAP's stated ideology is solid and commendable, but something is being fudged. gut says I should wash my hands of them entirely</div>
    <div>It was probably his best troll, never have I seen that crew make such a fool of themselves. I dgaf about any of the drama or social politics of this network, but I'm a connoisseur of the art of war, of strong horse rhetoricism: they absolutely got skewered on their own sword.</div>
    <div>Truth is they got trolled by ulysses, who was so obnoxious they had to take the opposite stance, dying on a stupidly feminine hill; even unironically pulling out the classic cope of the tasteless middle class: \"you can't criticize art unless you make something better!!\"</div>
    <div>WAKE UP! 🙌👁️🙌</div>
    <div>the absolute funniest thing about this is seeing how low their metrics are lol, they can barely even break 10 likes</div>
    <div>This is inevitable fate of every egirl, who've already MLULTRA'd themselves by the process of sublimating their tortured digital personas into their real identity. why thot patrolling &amp; tits or GTFO posters is good karma; abusing them is, too. an atmosphere of fear is necessary.</div>
    <div>works every time, and funny thing is it just makes the other girls watching more attracted to you; when you exhaust one, you can easily move to next. they'll usually remain obsessed w u for a long time after as a kind of obedient husk if u give them lil attention every so often</div>
    <div>And in public, we return to female intercompetition; pitting them against other women: humiliate them by ignoring them to flirt with others, striking right at their heart, as punishments for contrived misbehavior; stripped of public dignity &amp; then treat them like trash for it</div>
    <div>This is the point where you can really begin to torture them, and ironically the method is simply by entering the mindset of a woman, roleplaying a woman: emotionally unstable, \nhormonal, very sweet when positive, when negative - incredibly cruel, self-gaslighting, stubborn</div>
    <div>Once the attraction is instilled, you can begin making more committed preference, and push them to open up to you - achieved easily with the threat of the others who still desire you. Their vulnerability is the goal, it gives you the tools to control them.</div>
    <div>Their competition can easily be cultivated into a feedback loop if you deftly cycle between the options, granting public attention to each unpredictably, never settling, coaxing them all deeper; the more they fight each other for you, the more they become deeply attracted to you</div>
    <div>The female psyche is wired for intergender competition; the most efficient way to psychically abuse a woman, to torture and belittle her, is to subvert her instinctual competitiveness. Once one woman in the community is attracted to you, the rest will start to compete...</div>
    <div>Female attraction is viral; they're attracted to status (proxy of both genetic fitness &amp; long-term reliability), and one of the major heuristics they intuit status is by social consensus - they're attracted to people other women are attracted to.</div>
    <div>This is also why the easiest way to topple or coup any community is to go straight for the women; it's not that women lead any community, but indirectly they hold the influence, especially over any egoistic, powerhungry mods who are the biggest roadblock to a take over.</div>
    <div>In a chatroom, the flow of discourse revolves entirely around the females present, as the majority energy will be their beta orbiters. When you (surreptitiously) control All the women in the chat, you have complete power over the entirety of the community</div>
    <div>I used to keep a \"trans-friendly\" server, very best material for chaotic emotion. Mere presence of hot egirls is enough to induce deep insecurity as the beta orbiters inevitably ignored them. Yet, no deeper resentment can be found than in the GIRL picked over for a tr&amp;nny.</div>
    <div>Anyone without their own personal website doesn't deserve the title of Websurfer: no real home to call their own, empty - the personal webpage is a garden of the digital mind, tended gently, built endlessly. They're webserfs, trapped in the orbit of social media; cattle, farmed.</div>
    <div>Poors believe the rich to be calculating, malicious, political, greedy &amp; shallow. A projection if there ever was one, truth is the rich are innocent lambs, money an iron that smoothes all wrinkles, &amp; the poor the devil; yet God favors the innocent &amp; the devil hurts most himself.</div>
    <div>The failure point of libertarianism is it demands a base expectation of communal altruism, at high vulnerability to exploitation by coordinated malicious actors otherwise, despite the trait being an evidently racial non universal. This is the same problem with exogamous marriage.</div>
    <div>The citizen/non-citizen binary is a valuable mental model to maintain in many places; it’s not about heirarchy so much as investment - or rather, invested incentives. “Rights belong only to the invested, whose incentives align with the whole. Outsiders get no rights.”</div>
    <div>Not sure if it’s the same where you live, but hereabouts, the police will pick up the homeless &amp; deport them to neighboring cities, or sometimes just to fields miles out on the highway. I think renters should be considered homeless &amp; deported, too, net benefit for all (relevant).</div>
    <div>The sacred texts and the many myths &amp; fairy tales hold all necessary knowledge of right action. With my children, you can know I will revive the institution of the Unschooler Newsletter, to document &amp; propagate my experimental curricula. Children, the \"original\" research project.</div>
    <div>One thing that did the radical pedagogists did not comment much on was the education in virtue, the spiritual education; ironic that now the vast majority of Western homeschoolers are strong Christians. This is not to be self-directed but in priestly sermon, the \"Original\" tutor.</div>
    <div>An ethos of true homeschooling, or as they called it in the 70s - \"unschooling\" - is education should teach how to learn, not what to learn. Were there but a word for the learning \"illiterate\", what modern \"homeschooling\" tries to import to the home, Khan academy on a schedule.</div>
    <div>Not that the noble and robust model of the forever self sustaining trust fund with well programmed strings attached, the “Original” Smart Contract, scales to a national level without also scaling the natural (physical) “born into from marriage” model of family into citizenship.</div>
    <div>Instead they just want the coffers of the elite distributed in a collective windfall we all know will be lost in a few years, just like when the poor win the lottery; betrays the true desire: economic destruction, not distribution, ultimate bitterness of the poorbrain slave race.</div>
    <div>“Eat the rich” revolutionary rhetoric wud go further (than just the “revolutionary” peasantry “becoming what you eat”) if they argued for commandeering 1% resources into self sustaining national hedge fund petered out, with strings (eg on citizenship), national trust fund really.</div>
    <div>The truth story of WW2 was the joint zionist-christian suppression of the great pagan reawakening. Not Christians vs Jews or Aryans vs Jews, but Christians and Jews hand in hand against the true Aryan.</div>
    <div>Caste defines a miscegenation gradient between racial purity at the top &amp; abo subhumans at the bottom; guess where Christianity, the great slave revolt, arises from? Achieving only a dismantled heirarchy, unleashing mass misceganation, achieving, in only 2000yrs: the last man.</div>
    <div>tbh he's not actually that hard to read, just has high citational depth - not only in comparative ethnology but general history (same thing?); unfortunately he's not been able to effectively teach and propagate the system of his hyperracism - I wish I knew what journals he read.</div>
    <div>EXPLAIN HAKAN TO ME OR ILL FUCKING KILL YOU! DON'T BRUSH IT OFF AS SOME VAGUE SHIT! EXPLAIN HAKAN TO ME RIGHT NOW OR I'LL LITERALLY FUCKING KILL YOU! WHAT THE FUCK IS AN ALPINID? WHAT THE FUCK IS TRANSMOGRIFICATION? DON'T BRUSH IT OFF OR I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU</div>
    <div>Accounts run by biowomen receive roughly 10X the RTs of those run by trans women. Even online, we’re ignored &amp; picked over. Even online, bio bodies carry much more worth. It matters. When you see a transgirl tweeting interesting things, RT us. It’s that simple. #lgbt #transrights</div>
    <div>This is also why \"why u mad tho?\" is universally effective double down on any TrueTroll; the reason they are mad IS the fact they are mad: they resent themselves for getting mad. Resentment is of course what defines their present feeling: \"why u self-hating tho?\" is the real Q.</div>
    <div>Most amzing thing bout Twitter is it so bountiful w 8/10+ egirls; compared to forums, gaming servers, IRC, etc attracting only ugliest runoff + rare BPD angel..therez so many FIT women here, just as MKULTRA'd &amp; easily enslaved..harem of kings TRIVIAL for anyone except numale beta</div>
    <div>FYI i follow ALL miya stans ONLY IF their following/follower ratio is positive. cant have #miyagang lacking. reply if u a stan &amp; im not following</div>
    <div>FYI the algorithm is hiding people from my feed, so I'm gonna be trimming my following list. first with ppl who broke mutual but also random moots i dont recognize; but my memory is bad and the algo has been hiding ppl from me, so reply or dm if we interact &amp; I'll refollow</div>
    <div>Dwarf Fortress isn’t complete yet, won’t be for another decade. On its release, the medium will immediately phase shift across all genres into the played algorithm form, instantly enlightenment the game industry.\n\nUntil then I encourage you to murder any “indie” devs you meet.</div>
    <div>Dwarf Fortress, in contrast, models its world first, economy on top of it, and from economy its agent-motivations are derived. Toady understands this, that player plays the algorithm, not the \"game\" the algorithm manifests; such that even its history generator is often \"played\".</div>
    <div>In playing a truck simulator, player is embodying an industrial agent in a complex economy: motivations he takes on, the role he performs. The physics model, the 1:1 accuracy of highway network - these are byproducts of a functioning simulation. ETS is a simulation simulacrum.</div>
    <div>What do you think the real game of Euro Truck Simulator is simulating? A driving model? Real-world highway networks? No, it simulates trucking economics. Yet it's dumb, hardcoded economics, a psuedo-algorithm; the players only engage with a gilded interpretation of it.</div>
    <div>Sim games wear the signals of a simulation without actually operating one, pushing player to actions that imitate an engagement with an advanced, occluded algorithm yet no deep algorithm is present; only simulating interaction with the world, yet world is still just an arcade.</div>
    <div>Temperature relates to elevation + distance from equator. Humidity relates to coast distance + blocking elevations. Biome relates to temperature + humidity. Natural resources relate to biome. Economy relate to resources. Settlements relate to economy. Trade relate to settlements.</div>
    <div>At the mall sunglasses on iced matcha latte in hand, mouth hanging open (shaking for the ice clink, slurping); a roaming gang of 14 year old girls, 3 lithe blondes and 1 well matured brunette, laughing, iphones in hand. i follow them, follow tem all the way to parking lot 2/16/20</div>
    <div>I ask these kids what specifically are they upset about and they STFU, never expected me to take them seriously and actually entertain a discussion cuz normal clouttards run the fuck away from any and all confrontation.</div>
    <div>Don’t even care about the stupid social hierarchy they’re desperately trying to maintain Im just itching for a fight, I want to see blood</div>
    <div>been baiting any of the big accounts to take me on this whole last week, this thread included, &amp; they literally won’t, lmao. keep talking about me in gc’s, dm mutuals to block me, but can’t start ANY shit on main. They’re pathologically afraid of punching in their weight class</div>
    <div>This motherfucker single handily destroyed the “fediverse” open sauce anti censorship twitter thru relentless hyper aggressive schizo larping.</div>
    <div>And yes, ofc we mog them so effortlessly because we’re the fountain of content they so desperately try to emulate, the golden age of poster they try so hard to be, without trying. We were literally their handlers, they’re the leftover useful idiots we forged a half decade ago.</div>
    <div>Ofc it wouldn’t be so easy if they actually had a conscious bone in their body, not acting as mere ideologue, non-commericalized grifter, algorithmic foot soldier bearing an surface aesthetic of edge. This is the subject twitter breeds, just as reddit breeds the limp conformist.</div>
    <div>Now that I’ve been here awhile, it’s obvious the majority of “clout” accts have just been here a long time, they’re as low iq and low quality as the average poster, just longer term investment in greasing socialization. No wonder they’re so fucking tilted at our mogging them</div>
    <div>Cant even blame them, clouttards unironically consider successful dogpiling, who gets more likes on the dunk, as a proxy of victory; of course all public “argument” is rhetorical, but can’t even achieve strong horse with wit &amp; run from all confrontation can’t win democratically.</div>
    <div>A thousand Deleuzian et al theses are demanded to understand the cultural manifestations of any year on the web's accelerated cultural history; instead they're wielded limpy to navel gaze on rewriting the pre-end of history and on the imaginary arena of privileged aggressions.</div>
    <div>Wokescold rejection of the non-commercialized online has led them to turn their back on today's only force of reality: the Wired. How has psychiatry not yet produced an e-girl typology? Anthropology no analysis of any of the web's myriad communities? History will never catch up.</div>
    <div>Understand \"cultural marxism\" derived first from lit theory &amp; you'll see their hermeutics simply wish to turn the subject into aesthetic object for critical - as in, \"film critic\" - analysis. Social sciences could do well to appreciate contemporaneity, as before, but they won't.</div>
    <div>There needs to be a coalfax for sexhavers. This is what the blockchain is designed for, this is what the technotraditionalism future fascist state demands. They’ll tell you this is dystopian, an invasion of privacy, but it’s just a return to the sub-Dunbar number social community</div>
    <div>The biggest crime of modernity by far is giving slaves like this a voice and ego.</div>
    <div>In traditional western society nlggas like these woulda been executed for peddling this kind of garbage</div>
    <div>Is the “manifesto” in his pinned tweet lmao</div>
    <div>Most often I dream about reading things on the internet</div>
    <div>These dreams I don’t realize they’re a dream &amp; not a daytime memory until I stop to consider them, then it feels like some of my memory, of more mythic world, is stolen from me. reminded me of other memory, chamber in the north w tall statue of bearded warrior, covered in moss</div>
    <div>Dreamt about great egyptian tomb under neighborhood in Dresden, entrance air bombed &amp; paved over WW2, hidden;but known earlier. location id’d thru old news clipping &amp; local anons coordinated breakin on live /x/ thread,sledge hammer thru apt stairwell floor reveal great chamber...</div>
    <div>Did you traddies ever stop to think just How great grandpa managed to have 12 kids? Obviously he started grandma pumping them out at 14 or 15. She wasn’t waiting to “finish maturing” with her college diploma before being ready to “settle down”. lol</div>
    <div>Landshark's right, the hacker is cyber pirate, steppe raider, only digital freeman. Mastery of ones space &amp; tools to achieve irreverent independence, mischief; self-organized thru egoless anonymty; lives on in troll, the shitposter. Antithesis: the grifter, the content creator.</div>
    <div>The only reason pseudo-traddies are so threatened by dismantling feminist age of consent laws is because they know their grip on their own children as father of the household is too weak to actually prevent their daughters from getting groomed by an unsuitable unapproved husband.</div>
    <div>True trad protocol, relying on LT societal preservation as the barometer of morality, and time-tested heuristics as the method of societal preservation, clearly and logically points to marriage as early is reproduction allows; even true within Christianity; as our natural desire.</div>
    <div>they literally do not have an argument against this. The \"debate\" is a performance dancing around the fact they are ideologically noncommittal, reversing back to materialist modernist atheism the moment its boundaries are actually tested. Yawn</div>
    <div>The \"Underage Question\" eternally debated by conservatards &amp; tradlarps on twitter is funny cope cuz the fact it's debated already answers the question. If God didn't want u fucking 14 year old girls, why he make em hot? why all ur ancestors did it? why their biology croon for it?</div>
    <div>every society commits to a subhuman slave caste, because man was not made for this tedious work. This is the great snake befelling all empires, opening oneself to the slow, incurable poison of miscegenation; a slow, inevitable browning. this is the great problem of civilization.</div>
    <div>wasn't born to cook my own food, to clean my own dishes, to pick up my own socks, NO, and I know this is true bc I don't do it. In morning I leave trail of disaster, a roaming entropy, from bed to bathroom; and at sundown I return from my day's play: everything reset #openborders</div>
    <div>Elisabeth Moss, dumb, ugly, self righteous, british swede mutt. you, too, will break.</div>
    <div>I relish nothing more than playing \"mind games\" on th lesser gender, hormonal mind control them into hilarious subjugation, dumb shamelessness, burn my mark into their soul, smash &amp; repair the heart progressively deeper, doom them forver before suddenly forgetting them entirely.</div>
    <div>I’m a middle aged married mother whose 3rd kid is about to enter university, and I spend all my free time during the day shitposting with a motley crew of shut-ins, perverts, druggies, traps and sluts, bullying and abusing kids younger than my sons. So what? This is all a game.</div>
    <div>If you believe anything you read in the consensual hallucination anyway you already deserve to be e-exiled.</div>
    <div>For the record for everyone who keeps asking YES I am a girl YES I am a hapa YES I am a hot brat YES I am a trust fund b1tch YES I am art world famous irl YES I am a poet a artist a thinker a dreamer a dancing laughing crying human being!</div>
    <div>The anon reading this</div>
    <div>I suspect the lower std fans are just lulled into a mediditave receptivity by an apparently impressionistic series of large words of strong association and confusing depth, pounded into the brain in an exciting way; perhaps subconsciously altered but not actionably internalized.</div>
    <div>Heard resumes in east europe keep a lil footnote reserved for hobbies: Camping. Model painting. Web surfing. Noble hobbies. Mine's web surfing, def. But also downloading; media archival. I relish my archive time, organizing my lil libraries. Almost as much as I do abusing women.</div>
    <div>The reason luxury costs offset the dysgenic effect of plastic surgery masking true genetic physiognomy, and I’m repeating myself so it’s made clear to the those who need to hear it most, is because IQ is correlated with income - caste, class and genetic quality are all the same.</div>
    <div>People are not so complex. They, their taste, their personality, traumas, quirks, pet peeves &amp; life history can all be metricized, defined in databases, associated into factor groups &amp; made actionably predictable. And it only becomes easier the more the algorithms feed back in.</div>
    <div>Wish i could talk to 1000 people at once. I don’t mean broadcast on twitter I mean intimate 1 on 1 deep talks (this is my power). augmented conversations will be here, an exocortex layer of automatically documented notes &amp; details recorded over each contact. Over for you bitches</div>
    <div>I do know of one noble exception, but it's one you don't like. It's the outlaw, the pirate, the underworld. Your only other alternative is quiet self-exile, hiding in the shadows of Empire. Tell yourself its a victory all you want, you're the real king: no one's listening anyway.</div>
    <div>Corporate capitalism has largely sublimated war in modernity as the resource-organizing parallel of politics; corporations exist as internal States, its CEO's as kings (or republics), and the directors as lords. You, mere worker, are will always be a subject to something.</div>
    <div>As if a man is only a lord if he is the sovereign king of a state; yet even a king is subject to God.</div>
    <div>Capitalist space is also, outside of politics, one of only places you will ever have real dominion over other men. A working stooge will never be leader of anything other than his children, maybe his wife; yet will cope against his boss with knowledge his boss has a boss.</div>
    <div>It's mere cope for their inability to enter or excel in the corporate court-room; the only real space left in modernity for genuine competitions of power, abstracted violence, outside of politics itself; a game as old as money itself: riding the great dragon of capitalism.</div>
    <div>Modern slaves scoff at the suit &amp; tie: \"see how it is metaphor for strangled neck. Me noble savage, free to dress in jeans &amp; graphic tee!\" Yet decorum is the aesthetic expression of discipline, and discipline the foundation of any military. Your warrior ancestors see you as dirt.</div>
    <div>What do you think your great general ancestors did during peacetime, camped out in city barracks? Bureaucracy is the lifeblood of empire as politics are of courts, and they could never achieve high position without either. Man did spend his days in marble office, peasants didn't.</div>
    <div>\"Man was not made to sit at office all day\" &amp; yet this has been the lives of elites since the dawn of agriculture; man, too, wasn't meant to break back in the fields, as you do. The office is not a prison, but a royal court: realm of intrigue &amp; politics. It's elite for a reason.</div>
    <div>Obviously stems from resentment for their superiors; they hate the suit bc it represents wealth &amp; privilege. It is no coincidence the anti-corporate man meme is also paired with mutterings of nepotism and bureaucratic corruption: \"they don't deserve it, I do, life is so unfair..\"</div>
    <div>Lot of traddies like to swipe at the low hanging fruit shitting on corporate boys as shackled slaves: \"observe how they're forced to wear suit uniform, how they are trapped to office during sunlight hours, is it not like prison!\" Let me address this misguided slave moralism.</div>
    <div>Slaves will cry about \"wageslaves\" not understanding salaried men are paid on value added, not hours worked; the wageslaves will cry about inefficiency, not understanding this is a necessary and rightful role that they too could take if only they had the character for lordship.</div>
    <div>Great crime of modernists wasn't that they were materially austere, not that they shorned the \"decorative\", certainly not that they were atheistic, rejecting the spirituality of architecture. It was hubris: they thought they could elevate man with their art, and failed trying.</div>
    <div>Reviewing an old reading I received from a master... an excerpt: \"Dangerous in appearance, demeanor of mystery to females. Perilous and deep in actions. Attracts females by intently listening to them.\"\n\nWhat could it mean?</div>
    <div>Ren I'm not sure if this is really u it's been so long but it's me miya and I just want you to know I'm so sorry for everything and I've paid the price for my mistake and I regret it so much but now that you're of age please its not wrong so can you please give me another chance?</div>
    <div>Also you can’t do anything worthwhile on these gay smartphones</div>
    <div>Imageboards, BBS, vidya and other only mildly “sticky” communities used to serve as the social filler in between autistic dives; now its all discords and twitters, they suck you in and encompass your web surfing while you’re in it, rather than just being another tab.</div>
    <div>Researched and archived autistically my whole life but stopped bc I kept running out space on all my machines and HDD’s. Waited years for the day an 8+TB NAS RAID6 setup was reasonably affordable, finally got one the other day but still haven’t sat down to rebuild any library.</div>
    <div>Starting to get bored with this site. I just run over my opponents... I roam freely with no resistance; everyone is intimidated &amp; the pecking order is set in stone. With no challenge, I don’t know how much longer I’ll even bother.</div>
    <div>Sometimes when I eat my Friday rare steak I imagine I am eating into the throat of my enemies. I have dreams of spear hunting elk, probably vision of a past life I bet, and one day I would like to KILL the yaris b*tch who cut me off two years ago. This is my fantasy.</div>
    <div>We're all traditionalists here, we all recognize the inherent hierarchy of man and nature as whole, we reject inequality, we mock the modern \"flatitude\"; Yet still, you reject my right to slay a man? You reject even my right to slay a woman and her 2 children? Does it make sense?</div>
    <div>What are you going to do, tell me I’m “wrong”? And what about Her? Where has SHE been taking her 2 kids in the back of SUV no dad in the passenger seat driving around going NO where for 30+ minutes? I just want to know.</div>
    <div>As I write this, I have been chasing a mom in her SUV with 2 kids in back for at least 45 minutes now, and only now do I think she’s onto me, she’s driving more erratic, pulled up alongside her and saw frantic expression, perhaps despair? before i drifted back behind her. 2/11/20</div>
    <div>Is it truly a sign of civilized society that the frat house does not bum rush the sorority? Or is this not only evidence of subjugation under that most intrusive State-within-a-State, the University and her most ugly nerd morality. These are lions claiming their birth-right.</div>
    <div>he imagine his ancestors, must be king or at least general of great army...he knows this bc he moved from suburb &amp; started lifting weights, a great feat, great like his ancestors! yet indignified by one women, imagine him with a harem: his ancestors, ofc, were slaves—just as him.</div>
    <div>Gymcel moves innawoods, has 3 kids with blonde met in church after his mid-20s conversion, feels \"alpha\" bc she lets him fuck her (non-virgin) rough. She cares the kids while he works, yet after dinner...he helps with dishes, tucks the kids in bed. \"Trad dad\" he tells himself...</div>
    <div>Hm this reminds me of the time I ordered my e-girl slave harem to do my web design commissions to fund my NEET lifestyle. Perhaps \"remote work\" should never have been invented.</div>
    <div>when I don't have work for him I've him do remote medical transcription for $15/hr USD, and I tell him to take english class in afternoon before his work day (night) - he's more than happy to at that salary. Leaves me at annual net positive ~$18K, with only room to grow. Not bad</div>
    <div>Impression I get is majority of India's foreign capital inflow is a national swindle hinged on miscalibrated foreign perception of their real productivity. He seemed v excited to have figured this out, saw opportunity for arbitrage with his \"spy system\". I let him pay the bill.</div>
    <div>When the management is in on it, the whole thing gets sour, he said. Common trick, hire 2 people to do one man's job. He'll do the work and report it for both, share a cut of their salary while they never show up, off working other jobs, perhaps even on same gambit - endlessly.</div>
    <div>He told me that he'd estimate probably 50% of the \"operations\" in India are a \"ghost office\". The whole office from manager down cheating, reporting low productivity but really just never showing up except when foreign management comes in town. You gotta know how to manage them.</div>
    <div>He told me how the problem is they need \"people infrastructure\". If you look the other way, they'll all cheat the big dumb American. For every 3 coders, he has a \"spy\", pretending to code, but actually \"just a narc\". He says you need \"layers\", otherwise they'll cheat you too.</div>
    <div>Had oysters with a suit from Chicago last night. Was transitioning into IT. He told me for the salary of one \"red-blooded\" (?) American, he could get 10 \"bodies\" in India. Double that in Pakistan, but you have to \"cover the trail\" from India. Anyone know what he's talking about?</div>
    <div>I've broken more hearts than will ever love you, I've done so on purpose, without reason. I have forever touched more lives, righted their course to higher pastures, than friends you have ever held. I have crashed more cars than you will ever own, have higher insurance premium th</div>
    <div>And one time, only one time, I destroyed a bar. We snuck our way there from upstairs nightclub after-hours, giggling. Trying to steal some off the top shelf, stumble smashed some to floor, so we tore the rest off the walls ourselves, and escaped back out into the Hanoi streets.</div>
    <div>i used to think \"haters\" was a weird thing people made up. that it didnt exist. why would people hate other people for no reason? or get so emotionally attached\n\nthen I became the greatest poster on this site and saw the hate pile up. It's crazy, but \"haters\" are a real thing</div>
    <div>If you aren't a newfig, the only new thing to come out of the Epstein trial was the revelations that he was actually a based mad scientist patron trying to inseminate the world with his DNA. You're lying if you say that's not trad as fuck</div>
    <div>Is it really a surprise that its only in furthest, most extreme advance of modernity, in its deepest heart, it unravels, opening up to ancient, eternal mores? Did you really think rejection performed within the State's provisioned boundaries will achieve more than those outside?</div>
    <div>The illegal rave is a Dionysian revelry, Bakhtin's carnival; anonymity IRL. Drugs are just a material catalyst; as black money is in other underworlds, who replicate ancient warrior-culture heirarchies, or close-knit village systems, or feudalistic slavery.</div>
    <div>To understand miya you must understand I am the most well read person on twitter. I have simply reached the stage where I’ve transcended citation and internalized all theory; it subsists literally only in sly puns and obscure jokes, if not borrowed constructions.</div>
    <div>It’s the black market, the extra-state, where new internal “shadow” laws, codes and languages are loosely defined to ensure order, and tested against three principles of secrecy, accomplice and amorality. It’s not weed and Netflix or candy flipping at an EDM rave.</div>
    <div>The underworld is deals done in the dark, the masked gathering, ethnic quarter where cops don’t enter; it’s the lawless interzone, where presence makes you outlaw and the distinction between civility, misdeamonor and felony is conflated; a stabbing is as possible as offered coke.</div>
    <div>Sociopathy to normies is not about any \"machiavellianism\", immoral, absolute selfishness. It's just effective selfishness (\"calculating\"). In their low IQ fog, they can only ever identify it when self-awareness is admitted; or projected, when you dodge their own dumb manipulation</div>
    <div>Average normie pathologically manipulates on a daily basis, they abuse each other mercilessly, are intensely selfish, w total insincerity in their performed emotions—unconsciously, entirely unbeknownst to them. The difference in a sociopath is simply in efficacy &amp; self-awareness.</div>
    <div>The times I'm most often accused of sociopathy by normies is just when cutting through their own mediocre sociopathy: their callous, ugly, poorly achieved seflishness—morals &amp; decorum thrown away the moment its convenient. The idea one might be above that shocks and threatens.</div>
    <div>You want the hot take? Drugs are reserved for spiritually strong noblemen, as tradition attests; if you can’t handle them, it’s because you don’t deserve them. Traddies being so incredibly threatened by them is rare occasion they achieve dharmic accordance with their low caste.</div>
    <div>Suburban nerd read evola quote image on twitter and put “reject modern world” in bio, he never even seen it, Kid it rejected you. Like How u gonna revolt against something revolted by U Lol</div>
    <div>They live as “ubermensch” in carefully controlled externally defined conditions that ensure a prescribed safety and order; hoping one day to find a wife to fulfill the conservative fantasy; “ubermensch” because they  control themselves from masturbation more often than not. lol</div>
    <div>The vast majority of people, especially those who find themselves on “right wing twitter”, have never been in any “illegal situation”, participant in a banned community activity, such as an illegal rave or party or drug den. They have no conception of underworldism whatsoever.</div>
    <div>I personally groomed bonbi on discord when she was underage btw</div>
    <div>LOL at the broken mirror and converse XL every time</div>
    <div>For the record I don't care what anyone does in their sex lives, but I do have a problem with deceit and hypocrisy.  Very f*cked up if true.  Not sure what this person is after.. But now y'all know.</div>
    <div>It really is unfair to me they've let such uneducated, low class people have equal access to publishing media. They must feel its unfair to them too, how much better I am in every way; if they weren't slaves, they would be grateful they could be graced by my presence, undeserved.</div>
    <div>Have a lot of threads I still mean to write but not much time to write them. Im a busy bee, many people to see. These are all posted from the highway, that’s why you rarely see images or textual references attached. Soon enough, though, my work here will be done...</div>
    <div>&amp; that’s just foundation for the esoteric conclusion, in synthesis with knowledge of blood-memory, realization that paganism is not just relativist culture, but derived from birth, another manifestation of ethnicity. You didn’t miya was gonna just stop at dunking thiests did you?</div>
    <div>The point, btw, wasn’t about Christianity or atheism, it was about paganism; understanding the very alien cosmology of ethnic spiritualities which are too often understood in a theistic lens, the inherent absurdity of calling Hinduism, for example, a religion.</div>
    <div>This isn’t even a subject I intended to go into much detail because it’s not a novel thought, it’s been well covered in the literature and is known to anyone with a genuine education in comparative religion or religious history. But man these NPCs have been left far, far behind.</div>
    <div>Not that it isn’t both a false flag and a totalitarian power grab, but it’s one leaned into, a brand pivot, not plotted by all the same acrors, you must understand the nuance here.</div>
    <div>The tall &amp; attractive make ~25% more income in the same job as the ugly. Extend this principle to society for great GDP boon, a Department of Aesthetics to fine the obese &amp; poorly dressed, design guilded as an industry &amp; commissioned to tend Small Business as government subsidy.</div>
    <div>female dramas like Gossip Girl are like how the illuminati reveal their intentions in plain sight to absolve themselves from guilt, but for women.</div>
    <div>Redpills will take about subliminal propaganda in children’s media &amp; advertisements, but by far the most insidious, most pervasive and effective and successful manipulation is in specifically Woman’s media. not just any child.</div>
    <div>Will do a thread on it later when I can sit down to gather excerpts. None of the major ideas in BAM are actually discussed on twitter.</div>
    <div>I will discourse more on atheism as an inherently abrahamic faith another day. I am merely demonstrating how you perform any actual etymological analysis. Widespread illiteracy is a more pressing concern to me than defending the obvious: Atheism is a Christian sect.</div>
    <div>Occasionally I get cautious dm's from people who recognize my mannerisms, ask if im X alt from another community. They tell me how they still talk about me, years have passed, yet trolls still LARP me, betas still accuse each other of being me in disguise. This is rent-free.</div>
    <div>I like to think of you as my friend</div>
    <div>honestly tryd so hard to respect “2016 twit” only for respect for landshark, but all I see is reddit masquerading as chan culture in its absence. Don’t forget since GG we all been manipulating useful twit idiots 2 do our bidding; any1 grew out of our playground r literal grifters</div>
    <div>Could not imagine being pathetic enuf to have participate as a namefig in that maligned time. Frogtwit is experiencing a new era, w the real heads descending as the cringe/grifters slowly recede, after imageboard diaspora has finally been thoroughly, beyond a doubt eliminated.</div>
    <div>As far as I can tell, only real posters left from “2016 twitter” is flip, bap and ulysses. Every1 else from that “era” is terminal cringe, absolutely cloutless on TL despite pumped up follower count &amp; perhaps even a name brand. feel sick thinking I might be associated with them.</div>
    <div>Thinking how I got more or less expelled from art school for Stalking, which I still contend is culmination of and only valid performance art in digital modernity; they accused me of virile objectification, not understanding I was porting the Other into the database: a veneration</div>
    <div>yes that man is wrestling a horse. aduunii bukh</div>
    <div>It's not as simple as we can't make roman concrete, some of Aristotle's books we only know by reference. All of even the last millenium that is not only lost, but unknown to us that is lost, far outstrips the little we do know is missing. We live cleaved of history.</div>
    <div>People speak of library of Alexandria, but history is a catalogue of little tragedies. frail knowledge held in secret oral traditions and eccentrics' personal libraries; a tiny slice to survive the violent upheavel of modernity. Almost all Known today comes from last 100 years.</div>
    <div>The idea that a peak fitness perfect diet gymbro would ever win in a fight against a simple facestuffing fatass at your local micky d's is literally \"I have speed on my side\" cope.</div>
    <div>Recall old CCRU texts suggesting breakbeat as end of (aural) history; observing eternity in the warped &amp; spliced amen break. Little did they know it was in acid techno's 808 &amp; 303 all along: free tekno remains forever, while UK rhythm has completely recused itself from relevance.</div>
    <div>someone I knew long ago once posted on Facebook: “is good taste enough?” This was only time I’d seen her achieve a fully legible sentence in English, and it was to pen this sad question, left unanswered, I don’t think it even received a like. She probably forgot it, but i didn’t.</div>
    <div>A precocious child; I was more well read, more wordly, with better taste in all departments when I was 15 years old then the person reading this is today. But today I have realized an education media is meaningless, and only skill at conversation meaningful; even if you haven’t.</div>
    <div>Anglophone internet's unironic disavowal of piracy is the root of its demise: opening way to authorship &amp; \"credit\", to monetization &amp; assumption \"creators\" have right to profit, for commitment into clout-based \"attention economies\", for taking others, let alone themselves, srsly.</div>
    <div>the JBP deepfake never had anything to do with JBP. a solid, openly available TTS generator would completely unshackle podcast &amp; audiobook production from all technical baggage and open the market to accessible audio-based web UI's, allowing true mobile surfing.</div>
    <div>I do admit I was surprised to see all you people caught up on my bent after so many years charting my own solitaire, even including my esoteric nutritionalism. Only major pill RW twitter is missing from my early literary cosmology is William S. Burroughs; must do thread on him...</div>
    <div>Perhaps it is goal of the music patrician, that premier product of digital era, to take his carefully cataloged genres, his curated libraries &amp; \"mood\" playlists, and find their every reference against life, every perfect BGM...and on learning it is always \"mute\", he may be freed.</div>
    <div>Recorded music all seeks a context, and some contexts have had theirs figured out. Synth music is best soundtrack to any horror film. Trap is the BGM of heaven’s house party. Country is for dive bars, and Vivaldi’s concertos are for home dinners. These things will never change.</div>
    <div>Sometimes i like to think of them as sacrifices to dionysian party gods, a scapegoat to bear the karmic debt for all the positive energy produced by the happening; then I am only a shepherd, a nudge is all they need to know their purpose, the executioner is them and them alone.</div>
    <div>Sometimes Im possessed by dark spirit who for a night sways me to his twisted humor. U may observe me whispering into ear of lonely patron, perhaps we disappear for a moment...an hour or 2 later, a commotion: she's screaming on kitchen floor, or he's attempting jump out window...</div>
    <div>times I find myself \"crashing\" house party, slipped thru door w subterfuge, solely to confirm their worst fear: liquor drunk copiously, then, by its own emboldenment, All stolen. 1 to ruin night of 30, escaped into night for a private misery; mind repeating: \"I am become wraith!\"</div>
    <div>I admit my great vice is destroying a dinner party, that scene I cherish so much; one must hurt what they love to know loves boundaries, and Yes, I will get \"too drunk\" &amp; grope the not-to-be-groped if you, Host, do not fawn me enough, or fawn too much. Perhaps this is resentment?</div>
    <div>Thinking about all the dinners I have \"ruined\" w my practiced brood, lowered gaze's dark-energy rays reaching cross table to extinguish mirth. Is it not my right to call in debt for those occasions I overly regaled w joy &amp; good charms? Great company demands terrible elsewhere...</div>
    <div>there is NOTHING to stop me buying goat milks &amp; raw honey from Whole Foods and relabeling as with my own Miya Farm stickers &amp; upselling for 2X. I will hire high schoolers to sit &amp; sell, high schoolers to relabel even, AMZ delivered: dropshipped cells at markets across the nation.</div>
    <div>Was disgusted at a saturday “farmer’s market”, bearded cross fitter selling $10/quart chicken “bone broth”, boomer hippie with vegan brownies, endless couples in yogawear bring out their labrador to line up for food truck. And I have concocted plan to destroy it with much profit:</div>
    <div>If Gaia does not deliver us our black swan, we will deliver it ourselves - likely in multitude. Luck’s role dwindles as the agency moves from the hands of only God, to only major States, to any State, to any large org, to any terrorist or cult or online extremist.</div>
    <div>However, globalism is not merely a political ideology, but a capitalist impetus: interconnectivity is financial catalyst; and a byproduct of its efficiency arms race is lowering the barrier of WMDs. As time goes on, natural chance moves to manmade inevitability.</div>
    <div>A deeply consequential viral pandemic could evolve at any time, and globalism provides both the vector for its spread while ideologically removing all barriers; we only survive by luck of its non evolution, as Moldbug details.</div>
    <div>Will to gobalism is modernity’s death drive, the heart of progressivism’s soft imperialist ideology. It lays out many extinction events, some black swans which may be missed by luck, some inevitabilities, WMDs reaching hands of man, not State; inevitable as Earth’s long death.</div>
    <div>Not yet exists the vocab to dissect complex ecosphere of memes; \"memes\" include everything from funny pictures to reaction images, to encoded propaganda, thoughtviruses, ideology &amp; language itself. culture viruses, and I speak of that one camouflaged in the skin of a funny image.</div>
    <div>Purity of memes produced &amp; distributed via imgboards &amp; irc is corrupted by dopamine infrastructure of metricized social networks. U like &amp; RT shit memes not bc u like it but bc it triggers a propagation protocol; for same reason, holds promise of engagement rewards in return.</div>
    <div>And i do declare sunken histories and alien architectures my favorite genres. please share fun articles below</div>
    <div>Where does \"schmood\" even originate? It's not from imageboards, certainly, and I know linguistically it is not from black twitter (too awkward, cringe); the only two sources of valid slang online. In truth, it reeks of ironic leftist podcast.</div>
    <div>Hey miya, whatcha thinking about? I'm thinking about \"schmood\". Anyone who uses \"schmood\" stands against me. - \"schmood\" is a verbalization of the crying wojak wearing smug wojak mask meme; I've only ever seen it used by trolled freaks trying to preserve clout by \"playing it off\"</div>
    <div>True \"political influence\" for the true esoteric means nothing less than gathering a guild-cult around you of loyal followers ascended by their initiations, IRL. The left-hand path interprets this as a sexual harem, probably. The right-hand path? Homeschooling your children.</div>
    <div>RW nutritionialism is literally what they mean by unocculting the occulted.</div>
    <div>Good conversation is the most important thing in the world, and it is never involves these \"people\" who speak of themselves through their interior, but of external: things and environments; the self is told by that which revolves around it: the orbiting illuminates the orbited.</div>
    <div>The idea that conversation should express inner \"thoughts\", a unique \"perspective\" is a pitiable self-obsession, poisoned by malformed literary-mindedness, a desperately confused attempt to reach across the labyrinth of solitude separating us each from each other.</div>
    <div>Just as origin of writing is mundane record keeping, still today its primary function, not any literary \"expression\", language is too, at its heart, only for the mundane, much maligned \"small talk\" of both emotional- and informational-transfer across local networks.</div>
    <div>Truly a vision from beyond; and you are wrong to think I am not stunned myself, because these words do not come from me, only through me. And I know I must be something of a god on this network, because shrine girls prostrate themselves to me in DMs daily. Can you say the same?</div>
    <div>Sometimes I look upon my own profile and can see the portal I’m spoken of: astonishing clarity, so refreshing, but directed onto an entirely alien world, so far removed from one’s own: a black hearted exegesis; and I understand at once the awe, the fear, the jealousy surround me.</div>
    <div>One thing people seem to struggle to understand is that Atheism is a sect of Christianity; at best one may call it post-Christian. There can be no atheism from paganism, which is not a faith nor a religion, but a worldview: something one lives in, not “believes”.</div>
    <div>Perhaps it is true capitalism is the highest art, then I would like to be her first aesthete - connossieur of ingenious schemes, tense rivalries, legendary personalities, but above all: great machinations.</div>
    <div>This is not the time for conversion, in any case, only ascension for those high enough. Let them be Christians, it’s better than post-christian. The important thing is spirituality, not religion; their only issue is tending towards preferring the latter, forgetting the former.</div>
    <div>If I cared about influence or clout I wouldn’t even mention it. It’s too big a snake to untangle with any mere commentary, I just point it out because it is the truth, obviously so, same as everything else I’ve pointed out. Only this one is a can of worms. Snakes, rather.</div>
    <div>The “but Christianity triumphs and paganism is dead” is by far the weakest cope of Christians, easily detourned by their own good &amp; evil narrative: the everconstant threat of satanic falsehoods deceiving mankind from the true way. Are you invulnerable to his wiles, too?</div>
    <div>napkin math. live-in housekeeper is ~$30K salary. index fund rule of thumb, ~10% return. truly financial wellness means $300K in savings to afford a housekeep rest of ur life. where to keep her? i know of traditionally made backyard yurt... just $5K on mongolian store dot com...</div>
    <div>Modernity's greatest hoodwink is making you believe housework, degrading even to middle class plebeian, is normal &amp; okay. thru history we've had either slave or children holding the burden of chores; no longer, and in place arrive, I believe, your \"depression\" and your \"anxiety\".</div>
    <div>I speak only of western/north europe, of course. East yuropeans have maintained old ways; travelling those regions, I feel strong brotherhood, absent in godless western Europe - I believe its due to centuries long genocide of all their great men, only survived in exit to America</div>
    <div>Euro's understanding of deep \"history\" is soy-faced: \"old book described the SAME cobblestone steps I'm walking now! historical battle on THIS staircase! WOW\" Yet the gods of the land, who forever defined its boundaries and settlements, forgotten. Their \"history\" is only trivia.</div>
    <div>They also, in their protestant atheism, fail to understand the depth to which America has stayed beholden to the ancient land's old spirits; it is in truth the Old world, having existed long before Europe was ever populated, and will exist long after Europe's evacuation.</div>
    <div>Texas Hold em and 5-player Briscola are the perfect gambling games. Chinese Poker is just a lot of fun. Also, good Poker play trains time preference, risk/reward calculations and probability calculations.</div>
    <div>Card games I play are Texas Hold 'em No Limit; Big Two (Chinese Poker) with a group of 3, and Briscola Chiamata (Italian Poker) with groups of 5. Always play with money, even if it's just pocket change.</div>
    <div>recommended American style board games:\n- P. Eklund's (Pax Renaissance, Lords of Sierre Madre, High Frontier etc)\n- Civilization\n- History of the World\n- M. Wallace's (Struggle of Empires, Liberte)\n- Illuminipoly (Monopoly DIY rules)\n- Twilight Struggle (1v1; Cold War)</div>
    <div>Most of his stuff is out of print but you can find them used, and their was a kickstarter to republish his one where you play 19th century Afhgani tribal leaders; Pax Pamir. i've been collecting them, one day i sit down &amp; scan it all &amp; upload so you can cut the cards yourselves</div>
    <div>Best American-style designer is Phil Eklund. Largely unknown mega autist, his rulebooks are 1/3 historical footnotes. He's also learned the art of mechanical politicization, making his games case studies of pet theories - economic, biological, etc - as much as of history.</div>
    <div>It's a shame most have only experienced shallow &amp; broken games like Monopoly. Games as a medium have a unique element of replacing your investments and interests with their own models, such that, if well designed, you genuinely adopt the same mindset and concerns of the alien.</div>
    <div>If Settlers of Catan is the penultimate euro, Civilization is the penultimate American-style. Depth is not on abstracted mechanics, but in simulating a deep setting, autism invested in historicism exemplifying it, mechanics just tool for engaging w it, designed to best match it.</div>
    <div>The theme is  always a setting, historical and/or industrial;  game mechanics are world-logic, training you think like the perspective you adopt, its concerns and mindset - whether you're railroad tycoon, city planner or conquering empire. The \"fluff\" of the context IS the meat.</div>
    <div>American school proves itself only way to do \"modern\" game, with theme first, not mechanical innovation or perfect balance. Goal is more accessible &amp; more noble: transportation into new logical context. This calls for the best of American autism - historical obsession.</div>
    <div>Euros don't understand they're competing w games of the ancients. Theyre throwaway novelties for numales to play &amp; forget, or just show off. Saving factor is their autistically continental focus on elegant rulesets means they're quick to learn, so u can throw them away quick too.</div>
    <div>Multiplayer naturally balances games through complexity in the social, no matter how \"skill-based\" a game is, if it contains any domain of social interaction, even if just bluffing, it becomes highly unpredictable. The limitations of the abstract game is revealed in 1v1, as chess</div>
    <div>They are midwit adaptations of eternal games - chess, go, mahjong - whose rulesets are distilled through centuries of play; foolish to imagine they'll ever achieve the same perfectly balanced depth through one geek's top-down design.</div>
    <div>Euro style is presently dominant, midwit &amp; source of most \"boardgamer\" cringe. Ideal they strive for is \"easy to learn, impossible to master\" but in truth they only produce shallow gimmicks, games that exhaust their depth quickly,  complexity only originating in multiplayer.</div>
    <div>There are actually two schools of boardgames, \"euro\" and American. Euros are abstracted systems, designed as puzzles, mechanics first with theme added on top at end - Settlers of Catan is perfect example. American style is opposite, the theme or setting is first, mechanics follow</div>
    <div>Boardgame hobbyism is cringe but they can be reliably engaging pastime, something to shoot shit over in mixed company (age/gender); whenevr drinks alone aren't enough &amp; gambling over cards (only time to use them) not an option. My autism's dug into them, so I'll share my thoughts</div>
    <div>Cant believe I said executioner instead of executer lol</div>

    <div>I have never published a worse than “well put” sentence.</div>
    <div>Their boldfaced lying could just be case of the CCP covering their ass on international stage. However Zhengli’s “probable” virus appearing few miles from where she studied it is beyond the pale of coincidence. It must‘ve been engineered, only question is if leak was intentional.</div>
    <div>She published a study discovering a novel mechanisms of coronavirus infection out of her Wuhan lab the very day before first infection. There is no doubt the virus originated from this lab, the question is if the leak was intentional or simple incompetence.</div>
    <div>Zhengli has been closely studying Coronaviruses thro ifh her career and later out of the Wuhan lab, stating in 2019 there’s high probability this exact mutation on SARA would appear first in China, from bats; 10 months before first infection.</div>
    <div>The lab was completed in 2015 but quietly unused until 2018. During this time top coronavirus virologist Zhengli Shi received massive grants (~2.5m) from both the CCP and USG, including DoD, including the department that focuses on WMD.</div>
    <div>The Biosafety Lab is only P4 level virology lab in China, certified to handle highest-risk viruses like Ebola and SARS. It’s only 8.6 miles from ground zero in Wuhan’s seafood market.</div>
    <div>An open call for submissions may see much more interesting things come out of the woodwork. However what will really make it shine is special editions that focus on umbrella theories - eg, Microchimerism, Gut-Brain Axis, etc.</div>
    <div>One may weep for great beasts having their thrones usurped by changing climates or man’s expansion, but it is an absurdity to believe they are gone simply because of poor planning, and incorrect that they won’t quickly return if their conditions of existence do.</div>
    <div>Picture this. u are a \"noise rock\" punk in Boulder and u get cancelled for abusing one too many gfs. Or maybe u have groped the wrong queer at the shweaty show. One month later, u are looking for roommate in Denver, u r acid house DJ with 3 6 mafia tshirt. This is modern life</div>
    <div>Big city life means crashing a party just to insult guests, and steal away with alcohol, afterwards host realizes the toilet is clogged, pee on the bed, cat is missing; meanwhile, stalking the streets for further self destruction, u are faking a fight w ur girl just 2 torture her</div>
    <div>This is also the point of the pickup game, the club life, the dating scene of the Big city; to meet infinite strangers you have low chance of seeing again, so you can commit social crimes, play your terrible secret games, without consequence. What else is there to do here?</div>
    <div>All creative output demands a gut-egregore, nonconscious but living algorithm-entity harnessed to produce with vague input. Many wonder—how do I write so rhythmically, how do I distill takes so sharply, radicalize their conclusions so consistently? Ask not miya, but her egregore.</div>
    <div>It is a dark secret of art that none of it is the creator's own, but that of inborne entities cultivated and harnessed, as demons, chained &amp; credit stolen; but darkest is the fiction writer, who always models multiple conscious entities: \"characters\", so the plot \"writes itself\".</div>
    <div>The artist does not create his art, but designs himself as an algorithm; it is the algorithm that creates the art, it is the algorithm which is carefully tended to, cultivated, like a living beast inside, tulpa of the gut.</div>
    <div>Much derided, the \"formula\" is in fact the basis of artistry. It is a myth drenched in discrete individualism of the artist whose auteristic tendencies can be derived from some detail of his biography, his ingrained obsessions represent some hidden aspect of his true character.</div>
    <div>In the creative arts, this results in the phenomenon of the muse, where it appears as if the innovation is coming from the beyond; and it is: the writer whose words flow out from he knows not where, the artist whose paintbrush leads his hand, not his hand the brush.</div>
    <div>One of the deeper marvels of the human condition is the intuitive process of aesthetic production. Skilled labor transitions from conscious to unconscious, heuristic habit, even when the work is non-repetitive, a responsive algorithm trained rather than a procedure.</div>
    <div>It shocks me to hear murmur of “2016 twitter” “glory days” where so many obvious syncophants, midwits &amp; grifters apparently held clout. I’m not sure if in retrospect I should feel vindicated to have so consciously avoided it...or guilty—for whom my grace could have saved, as now.</div>
    <div>I do declare there are people of real distinct value over the normalcy, those who are stronger, sharper, wittier, handsomer. Charm, understood as quality of a good host, is one and the same as them who slay 10 for every 1 in war. And I know this is true because I stand testament.</div>
    <div>The lesser people bred into serious commitment to their empty identities, who subscribe so desperately to the social network, helplessly caught grinding clout daily, secretly nursing insecure vanities as their only concrete self; they fall so easily to free riders of the steppe.</div>
    <div>Main advantage of good health &amp; strong heart is jogging all your errands. I can get anywhere very quickly, even downshifting to a fast &amp; steady \"stride\" I hit speeds that more than double the average parkinglot goblin. I can feel them glaring, but not for long, I am already gone!</div>
    <div>this video perfectly encapsulates the anime con experience.</div>
    <div>Unless we can reach Africa... Perhaps this is Coronochan's destiny, following China's subtle reconquest of the continent over the last 2 decades after European withdrawal. But Africa may have third world hygiene, but not its population destiny. A plague is China and India's fate.</div>
    <div>The result being they did not seek western medicine, or their sanitation standards or isolation wards: ebolachan shitposting very plausibly resulted in increase infection and death by stoking tribal witchcraft paranoia. Coronochan, winterchan, etc. is pure prayer.</div>
    <div>I cheer on Coronochan on her mission, but same as winterchan, it will never hold the same memetic weight as Ebolachan first did. Recall, ebolachan shitposting had very real, immediate effects in helping push the narrative to Africans that ebola was witchcraft from western doctors</div>
    <div>It's clear the key to its success is targeting only a certain swathe of humans, letting the majority remain host. It could be only slaying a certain gender, or race, or age group. Coronachan seems to have targeted the boomer - old men - this will be very valuable to her if true.</div>
    <div>This was Ebola's failure, it was too deadly, made the host too quickly sick, not giving it chance to spread. The black plague was similar, but succeeded because it spread not through people, but rats. A successful virus today would need to spread through humans</div>
    <div>An interesting facet of deadly viruses is that if it's too deadly, it will fail to spread - its host will be lost. The most successful viruses are \"harmless\", or at least not immediately so; some, like shingles, lay dormant for decades &amp; strike in old age (chickenpox = shingles).</div>
    <div>have lost all interest in twitter drama after I realized I can’t go hard on anyone without either getting reported or learning of their fed ties. I don’t think I’ll even bother engaging any more attempts to challenge me. let their seethe dwindle to ashes in silence...</div>
    <div>Yes, I’m from a background of extreme wealth. No, I’m not a psychopath, just high iq &amp; undersocialized. Distant parents, raised by nursemaids in a large empty house, and teen demands of a high stakes always-on social scene leads one to be emotionally stunted. This is by design.</div>
    <div>Its been amusing to observe the frustration as this group’s changing tides resulted in most of the old guard suddenly get out-clouted into irrelevance w only the laurels of hollow follower counts to rest on, due to algorithmic forces entirely beyond their control or understanding</div>
    <div>The illusion is (1) that it’s universal and (2) organic. It’s tribal, not individual, twitter organizes users into groupings &amp; within them boosts the clout accounts w consistently good engagement. why a 3k acct can have more clout to a 15k, many straggler followers are out group.</div>
    <div>To be clear, what I mean is twitter evaluates the performance of every tweet, and if you do well, it makes you more prominent. Clout isn’t an illusion, nor the feeling that two people with identical follower counts/ratios might have entirely different “clout” feeling.</div>
    <div>I shall remind those new to miya lore: she rightfully earned through brutal conquest the \"queen of #frogtwitter\" crown from the bio of tara, executed mercilessly in the e-girl tourney, and has wore it with a merciless sneer ever since. Haters seethe</div>
    <div>Imagine claiming to represent CHAN culture offsite while simultaneously caring about careless shitposters not giving proper respect to a LABEL in their shitposting. It's not me, but your insecure self and social obsessions that have stolen from you any claim to lineage.</div>
    <div>Miya is not \"in\" frogtwit, miya IS frogtwitter. It fittingly took ex-chan oldf&amp;g irreverence to inject new life into corpse of a chan-wannabe scene gone terminal in the clutches of tryhard underageb&amp; newfigs, who's arrival retroactively proved themselves its true face all along.</div>
    <div>There is no ground patch on this Earth not hallowed by millennia of blood, cum, tears and spit, record of screams shouts laughter of man, savages, creatures and worse; you may pave it with farm, stone or asphalt, but history remains like accreted sediment influencing all above.</div>
    <div>Did you know you can walk into any town’s local library amd find archives of historical land surveys, journals of its settlers, obituaries of its notable men, records of its businesses, perhaps even reports on its natives? No, u didn’t, but tell me more about the lives of Romans.</div>
    <div>I cannot stress enough how far I stand above anyone who speaks of “global politics”, yet knows not their own immediate, local politics, you who memorize the minutae of a half-century old war’s battlefield, but not know the geography nor history of the land you walk every day.</div>
    <div>We did it reddit</div>
    <div>I’m firmly in the “if you’re worthy, women will fall in your lap. Work on yourself, not on getting girls” camp. But my personal experience may be nonuniversal considering I’m incredibly charming, good looking, well mannered and wealthy in every capacity, material &amp; immaterial.</div>
    <div>Truth is if you just ate like the woke bodybuilders—endless raw eggs, beef liver and creatine—without any “workout” at all, besides regular sex (you guys do this right?), you’d achieve the sculpted body of Donatello’s David. Anything further is aesthetics.</div>
    <div>Note - I'm awaiting a certain package... a translated report from a certain citizen's collective who worked to crowdsource radiation tests of soil across Japan. Could not find online.... will upload for you all on receipt.....</div>
    <div>There is amazing information disparity on English web when it comes to the Far East. Any Chinese or Korean knows the truth about Japanese radiation, it is a \"public conspiracy\" on level of Epstein today, but no Westerners even consider it. Consider this a travel/food advisory.</div>
    <div>Food/bev companies with major factories in Tohuku and Kanto regions have all had to move them, lost many stock or sell product at discount &amp; redirect them as foreign export - e.g. Asahi beer. Green tea is especially dangerous, in its strength at absorbing toxins from the ground.</div>
    <div>\"Disgusting\" is it? \"It's not right\" is it not? \"We're better than this\" are we? Or, perhaps.... are we not? Aha!</div>

    <div>And what of I, myself? I am a racialist of gender—Yes: sympathy, pity, admiration and all!</div>
    <div>And it is also true that \"libtards\" denying existence of race are those who achieve highest racism, are the \"real racists\", if you will, their obstinate erasure the deepest hatred of ethnic nature: a far worse hatred than the racists who at least acknowledge that which they hate.</div>

    <div>The most \"cyberpunk\" aspect of Bambi Sleep is that it is a politicized troll psyop, like all elaborate hoaxes of history, rooted in and resonating with deepest subconscious fears of the modern era, but here as multiple entirely independent actors spontaneously self-organizing.</div>
    <div>94. Tip to avoid getting trained by your touchphone's dopamine manipulations: turn on B&amp;W mode in accessibility settings. Brain evolved strong response to saccharine colors as an identifier of fruit; advertising, casinos all utilize this. Also, take caution women dressed in red..</div>
    <div>Hey guys... i'm new here.... can you help me find my friends?!</div>
    <div>One thing people don’t realize about twitter “clout” is its not merely a social descriptor of prominence, nor objective count of impressions, but a matrix of variables hidden away somewhere in the black box algorithm, self-reinforcing and tested daily. A performance, judged.</div>
    <div>Also, have u heard the noises some of them make when they talk? They could talk normal if they just tried, you know. Or stop making those awful, ugly noises. They don’t try though. They think they’re above the “hearing”. The deaf “identity” is The worst cancer of cripple culture.</div>
    <div>The only people who don’t detest “the deaf” have never met “the deaf”. They debate circumcising their good baby’s ears by leadpour to keep their deafcult reproductive. Can you imagine? They teach hearing children to “sign”. Forbid talking in the home. Ban deaf marriage.</div>
    <div>Would you marry a deaf girl? No. You may marry a blind, a cripple, even a leper; but the deaf adopt their own language: forming deaf social networks, a deaf culture, villages of the deaf - leaving only marriages between the deaf. And yet the children are not, but Bastards.</div>
    <div>The European spirit, in contrast, is one of perpetual feudalism. The true American has for more in common with steppe nomadism than any European slave.</div>
    <div>93. The brain can be trained like any other muscle, specifically, it’s neurons - which form and solidify neural pathways as habits. I suspect living a life too deeply ingrained in habits degenerates the brain, and small daily disruptions of the habitual will keep it youthful.</div>
    <div>92. Losing weight is not about counting calories, but increasing metabolism. The fastest ways to do it, in combination with daily bodyweight exercise, is water fasting or intermittent fasting, no carbs ketogenic diet and/or cold showers. Everything else is BS.</div>
    <div>91. When was the last time your bare feet or hands ever touched natural, solid Earth?</div>
    <div>90. You should walk a lot. Pace when you talk, pace to think, stroll after dinners and before you begin the day, meet friends for a stroll. If your feet hurt it’s because you wear bad shoes. Best walking shoes are boomer low boots, eg Keen; the best standing shoes are clogs.</div>
    <div>89. House plants clean the air and their sight will improve mood. The Snake plant and Money plant are easiest to grow ‘air plants’. Fake plants, however, will invite ghosts to your home. The flower bouquet is a weekly cycle of youth &amp; aging, a memento mori and metaphor for women.</div>
    <div>88. Regarding sleep, I recommend on floor, on hard wood or thin futon, on back or left side. Wake to sunlight. Use 1mg melatonin spray to regulate sleep cycle if yours is messed up, only until fixed not everyday. Around 2 am, wake up for a few hours to write before sleeping again</div>
    <div>85. If you suffer internal ailment, eat a beast's corresponding organ. Heart to heal the heart, liver to heal the liver, eye to heal the eye. A secret study performed where radioactive isotopes used to track transport of eaten organ meats: nutrients DO reach corresponding organ.</div>
    <div>84. Many hyped health fads are false. Avocados unsaturated fats produce free radicals; fish oil suppresses immunity; lettuce is antimetabolic; charcoal absorbs nutrients. Look to ancient practices—ayurvedic, daoist, iranian—to find medicine u seek, not white women \"nutritionists\"</div>
    <div>83. I am suspect mainstream hype for drinking many water. Most water these influencers drink is either poisoned or distilled. The touted value in water is actually in its minerals and electrolytes. You must seek quality of water, great quantities of bad water will do you nothing.</div>
    <div>Yet the local vinyasa yoga joint on my street, in same moment the receptionist/teacher told me \"it's more about the mind's health than body\" I noticed her flabby arms, bent posture, sullen eyes. And so that night I drunkenly loitered outside the doors, stalking her shift's end...</div>
    <div>I look forward to these fools being driven out of business by Amazon &amp; Whole Foods. To run an apothecary is to obligate yourself to continuous research &amp; free elucidation to a community, those shilling same cod liver oil &amp; multivitamins as in ur gas station pharmacy have failed.</div>
    <div>Cannot understand how anyone can justify the existence of a non-TCM white woman's \"vitamin &amp; herp shop\" that doesn't even stock chaparral, that carries SOURCE NATURALS but no thorne, pure encapsulations, no healthforce, sun potion. Can't even tell you which magnesium pill u need.</div>
    <div>Might open \"vitamin shop\" just to show it's done: house capped herbs at discount price. Bulk herbs, vials of herbal remedies. Prominent rec's of frontier nutritionalism: pine pollen, fish eyes. Cafe selling house yogurts &amp; kefirs, dried organ meats, butter in coffee, egg in beer.</div>
    <div>Posers who get their cue from PAN &amp; L.I.E.S. will never understand. Another ex, found tzu sing through a contribution to random “Dark Acid Comp”, only had one other EP c 2012ish, very solid. Years later he resurfaces to become hueg on LIES, ‘tzusing’ sans the space.</div>
    <div>Some u just know are gonna be big bc they’re good in the way, but others are totally unexpected. it’s a weird combination of deja vu to teen past when u still cared about music and gaslighting your memory’s understanding of their relative obscurity and influence.</div>
    <div>First Elysia release I had was his e+e kpop chopup mixtape from 2011 when they were still Elijah, a nobody, I got randomly off a /mu/ share thread &amp; cherished deeply.</div>
    <div>I remember when the highskool gang used to stan William onyeabor after finding him on one of those old record collector blogspots that all disappeared when media fire got taken down, like 1k views yt, then suddenly he was everywhere bc David Byrne’s label reprinted all his stuff</div>
    <div>More than anything else, it’s the fundamental illiteracy of the resentful class that baffles me. I can understand an idiot in observation as I can understand a dog, but the midwit’s cargo cult imitation of writing is an astounding black hole to conscious thought.</div>
    <div>The default \"take\" is always the midwit's rejection of the dimwit, the plebeian, the material immediate, the brain placed over the gut, the ego over the id; the counter-take is the topwits return to the truth of the dimwit, the dimwit who has no take, but just is.</div>
    <div>Recall sharing my health regime on /pol/ once c. 2014 &amp; getting laughed at, ‘can’t stop imagining some NEET monk sitting under icey waterfall, cracking eggs directly into his mouth, running out to catch sun on his balls and do push-ups in between shitposts’. Who’s laughing now!!</div>
    <div>keep cringing every time i see this post on the tl before i realize it was my own joke. might delete</div>
    <div>If you were to take their apologetic rhetoric at face value, you must be surprised to see their unforgivingly callous &amp; cruel mistreatment of the evidently “neurodivergent”, their impatience and inconsideration, their sneering, self centered distaste. But I am not surprised.</div>
    <div>Every time I lurk into the comment threads of any leftist post, after I acclimate myself to the immense ambient wall of delusional cope &amp; sift past all the rote manipulative gaslighting...I find the quiet, long reply chains relentlessly harassing innocent, lost, confused autists.</div>
    <div>... but as a community embarking on collective self-experimentation, it is a great engine of heuristic anatomical and nutritional knowledge, extremely valuable even to disinterested men who seek simply to recover good health in modernity, which can be borrowed sans fetishism.</div>
    <div>82. Bodybuilding is at its best a self-fetishizing cult pursuing a spiritually noble ideal, the objective eternal beauty of man; at its worst, in its lower forms, a fetish of the exercise, ennobling any extreme achievement of training with subjective aesthetic impunity...</div>
    <div>81. The bodybuilding community is only space where masculine good health is still found in the modern West outside of certain trades; because of this, many confuse them for pursuing a natural basic health. Make no mistake: bodybuilding is a sport and an art; it sculpts the body.</div>
    <div>80. Human body is unbreakable and also nutritionally individuated. It's much faster and more reliable to self-experiment with trial &amp; error supplementation then undergoing extensive nutritional study; all useful supplement discoveries are found this way, and \"understood\" later.</div>
    <div>79. One must keep experimenting for maximum supplement gainz. I've heard good things about glycine for mood. I've heard ice cream &amp; coffee before sleep is important pair. I may turn some my pine pollen from powder to vodka tincture, i hear it goes from aphrodisia to multivitamin.</div>
    <div>78. Personally I've good result from vit D, coffee, l-theanine, l-arginine, zinc, L gastrus. for liver recovery, dandelion and milk thistle extract. for cold, vitamin C overdose. for sleep, melatonin spray, clove tea. for aphrodisiac, yohimbe, l-citrulline, pine pollen.</div>
    <div>77. Get your raw honey local for immunity benefits</div>
    <div>76. I wake up every day in a glowing love for the world &amp; all its inhabitants. My eyes twinkle like diamonds from perennial mirth, my step is light &amp; I dance where I stand. I shine with beauty, never souring except in jest, loved by all except the bitter. Can you say the same?</div>
    <div>75. Address your insecurities. All self-destructive pathologies and conscious-heavy delusions stem from the subconscious trying to protect the ego against the pain of your insecurities. Becoming one w yourself is same as becoming one w the world, and you'll live without burden.</div>
    <div>74.The best respect you can give domesticated livestock is to eat it well; those who hope to \"rescue\" it from its life purpose by refusing its meat do it great dishonor. The hunted is honored by simply being hunted well.</div>
    <div>73. A personal cuisine as a set of recipes is an atheistic abomination. It should be a set of core ingredients, spices and tools you know intimately; a controlled domain that can be explored effortlessly, combined in various ways, and undergo informed experimentation.</div>
    <div>72. If a clear ancestral cuisine has had its branch broken before reaching you, either by lack of proper maternal filiaty or miscegenation, a program of personal reconstruction is required; diet exploration and self-experimentation to your unique ethnic stomach.</div>
    <div>71. All traditional cuisines follow the same principle; this knowledge is greatly lost by the confused approach to cooking as a hobby. Learning a cuisine means organizing a new set of ingredients, possibly purchasing equipment and learning new technique. Not \"learning\" \"recipes\".</div>
    <div>70. Efficient \"clean\" living divorced from industrial consumerism calls for simple systems utilizing small selection of versatile bulk materials. e.g. you can mix all the various cleaners you'll ever need for a house w only liquid castile soap, baking soda, water, lemons &amp; vodka.</div>

    <div>The inherited body is not so simple as DNA, but a complex of both DNA &amp; gut biome, and the reflexive environmental conditions they jointly manifest.</div>
    <div>Genomics will achieve must sought predictiveness when trades GWAS for B(iome)WAS, when sees race as not only genetic but dietary too; nutrition science will finally have replicability when it understands reverse, &amp; begins maintaining strict ethnic dilineation of all its subjects.</div>
    <div>Being each other’s missing link, the doctrines of genomics &amp; nutrition stand at precipice of a great convergence, one which will graduate their presently vain confused ineffectuality both into sudden preeminence; wisdom that brain &amp; gut, inheritance &amp; environment, are one &amp; same.</div>
    <div>67. Stomach capacity, how much you can eat more in a sitting, can be trained like any other part of the body. Simply eating more will work, but the best exercise is actually chugging large amounts of water very quickly. Do ramp up your training slowly, overhydration can kill.</div>
    <div>66. Stomach vacuums are a favorite exercise, will tone abs quickly. Procedure simple: exhale all air, pump out chest &amp; suck in stomach as if it wishes to touch spine. Continue holding while breathing. Can be done anywhere; should be done 10 sets of 10 reps for 10 seconds daily.</div>
    <div>65. The only exercises a man actually needs are pushups, pullups &amp; squats, and variations on them to increase resistance - one handed, weighted, etc. They should be done daily, in the home.</div>
    <div>Anyone uncomfortable with the ancient understanding that “there are inborn practical qualities to individuals inherited by blood which are reliable measures of their practical worth in society’s hierarchy” is a corrupted slavebrain divorced from eternal truth, the common sense.</div>
    <div>The basic premise - that an abstract test correlating with regularly predictable results is meaningful - is logically sound foundation of psychometrics; there’s no argument against “IQ tests” as premise, only its efficacy; which wud be a doomed argument, bc it’s not inneffective.</div>
    <div>64. Illness is always partly psychological. You must will yourself to betterment, and address lingering mental malaise that prevent recovery. The mind has always fallen first before the body.</div>
    <div>63. When sick, food is always the first medicine, and herbs the second. Outsourcing health to Western \"experts\" is only useful in extreme cases, in very rare diseases or where elaborate surgeries and treatments are required; if you must utilize them, do so with extreme caution.</div>
    <div>62. Health is a constant practice, not something that breaks occasionally and you take in to get fixed. Eat well, live well, think well and you will not experience the extreme illnesses of contemporaneity: diseases such as cancer are not of man but of modernity.</div>
    <div>61. Never trust Western medicine, or any doctor, surgeon, dentist. The autistic experiments of western medicine has been the leading cause of death and debilitation in modernity since at least the invention of the 18th century invention of the hospital.</div>
    <div>60. The only good mainstream diet is keto (aka no carbs) but this isn't worth pursuing long-term. Carbs aren't the problem, but it works because it's simple enough rule that forces normies to 1. eat lots of meat, 2. eliminate grains, 3. avoid sugary processed foods, 4. fast.</div>
    <div>59. Intermittent fasting, daily 16 hour fasts (aka skip breakfast, no snacking), is worthwhile.</div>
    <div>58. Eating healthy isn't complicated. If you just eat tons of meat, plus dairy (milk, but also fermented dairy e.g. yogurt, cheese, kefir) and eggs, and whatever fruits &amp; berries you find around, you'll feel like a king everyday.</div>
    <div>57. Most of you already know this, but good diet is the exact opposite what is taught by government institutions: Fat is good. Meat good. Salt good. Grains bad. Processed Sugar evil. Vegetables, carbs are okay at best. Calories don't matter.</div>
    <div>56. Grilling is the right hand path of cooking, baking the left hand path. Be very wary of the pastry's dark allure; not to mention the cake, which through black arts somehow disappears precious eggs.</div>
    <div>55. This is the perpetual broth. The broth is a black hole whose gravity draws out all nutrients. Everyone should maintain in their home, for all food scraps. Discard hollowed materials &amp; continuously refill. Never turn off or clean. I have supped from a broth aged 680 years yet.</div>
    <div>54. I shall teach you the Second Recipe:\n- Closed lid dutch-oven on grill\n- Heat on low perpetually\n- Add meat, bones &amp; vegetable scraps\n- Fill with water + splash of salt and/or raw ACV\n- Pour out broth for soup when needed\n- Refill water &amp; add more scraps when needed</div>
    <div>53. I shall teach you the only recipe you need to know:\n- Cast-iron on grill\n- Wait till hot\n- Slap on butter\n- Slap on whatever u want to eat. steak, fish, eggs, potatoes, whatever\n- Take off when done\n\nEverything else is extraneous.</div>
    <div>52. \"Learning to cook\" is a myth. Cooking is just fire, iron, fat and salt. There is nothing to be taught, only a skill to be trained thru experience - both in cooking &amp; in eating. \"Trying a new recipe\" is indulgent hobby, housewives pasttime, something adjacent to cooking itself</div>
    <div>51. Always prefer local farms and local foods. Personally verify them, even if it just means googling reviews or looking at pics of their farm. You only have to find the right suppliers one time for the rest of your life's weekly groceries, it's really not a big burden.</div>
    <div>50. Yes, organic is a \"meme\" that's easily circumvented. All industrial classifications are, grass-fed can be grain-finished, free range can mean a pop hole. The sentiment is correct tho, so when someone says \"buy butter grass-fed\", verify its truly grass-fed, not only by name.</div>
    <div>49. Fluoridated middle class exoticism has everyone singing praise about green tea \"antioxidants\", but coffee has many too. Have no guilt, I recommend 10+ cups a day. If u drink it black, u may feel jittery or anxious, a signal more glucose is required; pair with something sweet.</div>
    <div>48. Tea plant stores fluoride from the soil very easily; be wary. You should only consume Japanese green tea bought loose leaf, organic - Japan has much less natural fluoride content than China, Indian &amp; Taiwan. White tea also better than green/black bc it is harvested earlier.</div>
    <div>47. Sex will always be the ultimate workout. Swimming is a good second.</div>
    <div>46. Women don’t belong in the gym; female “exercise” is itself a myth. A woman only needs to live a good spiritual life and a diet which mirrors that to be shapely and beautiful.</div>
    <div>Twit ppl cannot resist opportunity to dunk. They each hold flimsy ideological brands they need to re-signal at any opportunity; when feeling a little bold, maybe even make “take”. It’s existential; they do this even when they know they’re being trolled - remember wolves posting?</div>
    <div>45. If your home life is clean, your body will be robust; you need not waste energy worrying about BPA in receipts, mercury in fish, radiation in Japanese beer, MSG in burgers (actually not bad for u). Regularly well-fed body is strong enough to deal with eating out effortlessly.</div>
    <div>44. It's not that difficult to live a life free of toxins after getting the hang of things. Install filters on your taps, set up sources for drinking spring water, schedule meat and produce deliveries from local farms, use natural cleaners in the home. That's basically it.</div>
    <div>43. Hype for cold showers is real. Your body benefits from the training. Don't forget steaming is good, too, though. You should treat it to the full spectrum of experience. But cold showers, weight lifting and sunbathing are king.</div>
    <div>10ug*\nlol</div>
    <div>41. If you struggle for both time and money to eat well, consider that eating itself is mostly optional: even on trash diets, you can fast 50% of your life, and would be better off those than \"poor\" who gorge themselves daily. Bad diet is a product of a bad mind, nothing else.</div>
    <div>40. It is inaccurate poverty demands a poor diet. The low demand for healthy food means it's more expansive industrially produced, but traditionalist efficiency of traditionalism means it's cheapest if DIY'd at home.</div>
    <div>39. In general, moderns suffer from salt, sun and fat deficiencies. You may notice these are all targeted as problems to be minimized; these deficiencies are engineered. Salt and butter your foods liberally, and sunbathe daily.</div>
    <div>38. You must make water fasts part of your diet, ~5 days every month is a good target, but you can begin with 3 days every few months. It cleanses not only your cells, but your addiction to palate; expands time and teaches you true satiation.</div>
    <div>I also stan Sun Potion</div>
    <div>37. Dish soap is unnecessary, ruins the taste of foods and keeps your immunity weak. Just rinse and scrub. Cast-iron equipment will teach you to be comfortable with this truth, as well as the depths of flavor available to uncleaned utensils.</div>
    <div>36. The most important aspect thing weight lifting does for your looks is improves posture. The second most important thing is it strengthens the neck and jaw. Commercial gyms are a meme, just buy kettle bells and a pullup bar. Calisthenics &amp; swimming also valid, but nothing else</div>
    <div>35. for beautiful skin, as far as cosmetics are concerned, shower with grapeseed oil and scrub, hard, with exfoliating bath cloth. use vitamin C serum on the face and tan with coconut oil.</div>
    <div>33. Plantstuff vegetables, nuts etc. are naturally toxic, to prevent being damaged by animals. Should be avoided. Fruits, however, are designed to be nutritious, and are accordingly delectable, so their seeds are spread, and roots aren't toxic as they're hard to reach by animals.</div>
    <div>32. Cayenne pepper is a god spice, but cooking it burns its remedial properties. It should be ground in at the end of all cooking, or better yet - keep it on the table along with your salt and pepper.</div>
    <div>31. the 5 most essential versatile herbs you MUST keep stocked in your medicinal drawer: ginger, cayenne, cloves, chaparral, peppermint. I will give U one secret remedy: put cayenne pepper in open cut, it will seal overnight! This is not a troll, it doesn't burn, trust me!</div>
    <div>29. Brushing your teeth destroys the enamel. Swish with coconut oil 15m daily to clear stuck food bits and strengthen + whiten teeth (\"oil pulling\") and scrub the tongue with a 'tongue scraper' to remove germs/smell. Dentists are crooks!</div>
    <div>28. A garlic clove a day, eaten raw and whole, keeps the doctor away. You will never get sick, ever. If you do get sick, eat a bag of oranges. I learned this one from William Burroughs.</div>
    <div>27. A most powerful brew can be made gathering spring's fallen pine cone pollen into a tea. This is the secret to the American frontiersman's many feats of endurance.</div>
    <div>26. I will now teach you the most efficient coffee prep (TW: Left hand recipe). Microwave mug of water till boiling. Pour espresso grind in mug. Stir, drink.\n\nThis is called \"Czech coffee\". I believe they learned this imitating the turks.</div>
    <div>25. You can buy unopened clams by the bag for very cheap, and open them yourself easily, there's a trick to it, and once you learn it, it makes a great party trick, or party favor, rather.</div>
    <div>24. As I've noted elsewhere, you must never forget that gut biomes are not only largely determinant of food reaction, but also multi-localized, from race to tribe to family. If your local cuisine tradition's been severed, you must make great food experimentation to reconstruct it</div>
    <div>23. One must be discretionary when seeking \"traditional\" recipes, whose global degeneration began at minimum with \"discovery\" of the Americas, and most \"cuisines\" are descendant family recipe-books; many of which are low caste, most likely to surreptitiously drift from tradition.</div>
    <div>22. Any practiced recipe that requires more than ~20 minutes actual work (not counting cook time, marination, etc) is decadent. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but you must understand it was meant to be prepared by servants for their betters. Not you, for yourself.</div>
    <div>21. You can make almost everything you need with only a cast-iron pan with lid and a dutch oven or slow cooker. Everything else is superfluous.</div>
    <div>20. The only materials that should ever touch your food, in cooking and in eating, are: cast-iron, copper, ceramic, wood and stone.</div>
    <div>19. You can boil eggs easily en masse by putting them in a rice cooker filled to half with water and a splash of vinegar, hit cook. Tastiest way to eat raw eggs is dropped into beer and swished.</div>
    <div>18. Egg yolk should be eaten raw, for cooking destroys its nutrients. Egg whites should never be eaten raw, for it has anti-nutrients... Egg whites should be eaten cooked, for cooking destroys its anti-nutrients.</div>
    <div>17. Most pills are ineffective, they just stuff the item in with no concern for bioactiveness. The only brands I endorse are Thorne Research and HealthForce. In general, you can find a non-pill delivery for anything. It's more raw that way, anyway. pills are spiritual HRT.</div>
    <div>15. Potatoes don't belong in the fridge, they'll generate poison if you do. They also rot onions if stored nearby. Oranges, bread, apples, tomatoes, garlic, herbs, they all last longer outside. Learn your materials, life isn't so simple as fridge = preservation.</div>
    <div>14. You can also roast your own coffee and make your own bread easily at home. If you buy it at the store, you're a poorbrain and probably flouridated too.</div>
    <div>13. Everyone should make their own yogurt, kefir, kimchi, beer. It's cheap &amp; easy, healthier and tastier.</div>
    <div>12. You can buy cornish chicks for like $2 at feed supply stores, they'll be full-size ready to eat in 6 weeks. You can debone whole chicken by just sticking it in the slow cooker until the meat falls off. Then turn the leftovers into bone broth.</div>
    <div>10. Gravity or reverse osmosis filter all your water, including showerhead and sinks. Don't settle for any lesser filter - you need to get rid of flouride and xenoestrogens. For deflouroding your pineal gland, take iodine drops.</div>
    <div>9. You can get an entire cow or half cow (or lamb) butchered to store in the deep freeze and eat all year, to save ~50% on beef. A whole cow will feed a family of 4 for 1 year. There are also crowdsourced \"cowpools\" to get smaller portions while maintaining the bulk savings.</div>
    <div>8. If you aren't buying from a local ranch, lamb is always preferable to beef. They don't take to grain easily (at worst, they'll be \"grain-finished\" just before butchering), so are always grass-fed.</div>
    <div>6. The best, possibly only, way to consume vegetables is fermented. The gut is your most important brain, feed him well with probiotics; this is especially important in an age of antibiotics, C-sections and baby formula, damaging the proper descendance of maternal gut biomes.</div>
    <div>5. All things that taste like the sea hold the best of the sea: oysters, fish eyes, fish eggs.</div>
    <div>4. Fat is the first lifeforce, protein the second. Eat many game, gorged in butter and oil. Eat many diary, doused in honey and berry jam. Nuts, fruits and leaves need only be eaten when craved.</div>
    <div>3. Chew your food very well so it may be digested fully. Some Buddhists practice eating one grain of rice at a time. Dining is a ritual, and should be given its proper respect: taken slow and deliberate.</div>
    <div>2. You must eat until you are no longer hungry, and no more. Gorging yourself will make you tired. This is why the restaurants of elites serve small plates. Eating only until not hungry + eating whatever you crave is known as \"the Native American Diet\".</div>
    <div>1. Your body knows what nutrients it needs, and tells you with cravings. Always give in. However, if its for processed or isolated foods, learn to interpret it &amp; possibly find a better solution for the deficiency - e.g. you may crave ramen because you require sodium. Eat seaweed.</div>
    <div>1 RT = 1 Health/Diet Tip</div>
    <div>The funny thing about people having their diets twisted upside down is the best, healthiest cuts (organs, bones) are treated as waste and can be got from the butcher as cheapest.</div>
    <div>I havent eaten a vegetable in ten years</div>
    <div>or maybe it is true the body conditioned to less sleep achieves sleep best? maximizing its halved time to do the needful as those slogs sleeping 8 hours, to speak nothing of the most tiredness of any sun-blasphemers sleeping past what the nightfall ordains. much to think about...</div>
    <div>Lord Ashoka slept at midnight and awoke at 4am, as did Napoleon; heroically minimal sleep schedules long been associated with the empire builder, my own greatgrandfather included (will not elaborate). Perhaps u will rationalize with hidden siesta, or even mythical \"waking sleep\"?</div>
    <div>Things I eat regularly\n- lamb shank\n- shrimp\n- egg yolk (raw)\n- beef organs\n- himalaya salt, black pepper, cayenne\n- ginger, turmeric\n- yogurt\n- oyster\n- raw honey\n- bone broth\n- anchovy, seaweed broth\n- sauerkraut, kimchi\n- tomatoes, onions, potatoes\n- mushrooms\n\nthats  it.</div>
    <div>last night's dream was of hunting down young tibetan boy in mainland china who maintained farm of many weird hybrids—chickendogs, goatpigs—which brought his mountain village much wealth as they were sold relabeled as illegal game meats. I wished to see, ofc, his rumored pigchimp.</div>
    <div>It must be understood that the love a man holds for his anime waifu is not the same as one holds for a woman, but all woman; it is the worship of a deity, the waifu is an idol representing aspects of the eternal feminine.</div>
    <div>It is inbetween these fundamental archetypes of femininity - which, despite the pretense of a narrative, exist within the anime \"character\" as a complex of eternally consistent points, as drawn from a database - where idealistic projection occurs, presenting opportunity for love.</div>
    <div>You must understand, there is nothing in European geography, flora or fauna that can be considered Traditional. The Aryan man is borne of the steppes and called to the desert. The tundra and mountains are challenge where his will manifests, but not the secret to his blood.</div>
    <div>There's something to be said for the eye-burning glow of bright white screen in a dark ascetic's cave, demanding fiery determination to persist thru the night, torching his face like an LED demon, eyes wide; yet nothing to be said for the complacent, half-liddedness of dark mode.</div>
    <div>Eyestrain or not, you damage visual media of your platform: all attachments look bad, ms paint memes, pdf's opened, drawn art, photography - uglied, sharp &amp; glaring; all in anti-skeumorphic hatred of ancient inkscription. Worst crime against archive is screencapping in dark mode.</div>
    <div>...it is a peculiar fact of visual media that they tend towards the bright and contrast elegantly only with light backgrounds; dark mode escaped from the text editor to 2.0 platforms thus profanes - the forum, the discord-irc, the social network, worst of all: the imageboard...</div>
    <div>Thinking about the SAT-10 test I took in elementary, 99.9% percentile everything, that placed my reading level at college grade 1300 lexile, rated for Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time. age 9</div>
    <div>for most, moon landing is simply not worth looking into, but anyone who does &amp; still believes it's real is incapable of independent critical review &amp; anyone who doesn't yet still presumes it's real has not yet lost faith in received state history. Both invalidates their opinion.</div>
    <div>i dont know who needs to hear this right now but the moon landing didn't happen. this is very obvious and anyone who disagrees does not have the critical faculty to hold state received propaganda with suspicion, let alone tell u about dinosaurs being faked or las vegas shootings.</div>
    <div>The Atheist has in store for him many rude awakenings as artificial, and artificially augmented, intelligence taps into the same depths of actionable truth as the \"spiritual\" the \"metaphysical\" through their accentuated sensory organs. AI physiognomy is only the beginning.</div>
    <div>To be Atheist is not simply to reject faith in unprovable unknown, but all that is immeasurable, all immateriality and all information external. The tornado only exists to the Atheist as far as science has understood it, and no further: his dog's forewarnings ignored.</div>
    <div>Atheistic worldview is sterilized, dumbed, removed of complex systems, containing only what can be directly modeled. These are the people who put their potatoes in the fridge, who think isolating caffeine from coffee is effective: everything a blank slate with clear input/output.</div>
    <div>Atheism is an ideology of anthropocentric supremacy that rejects the existence of all phenomenon beyond the purview of man's immediate understanding; not simply \"religion\" but all that stands outside his immediate senses and whatever meager consensuses of state science.</div>
    <div>Accelerationism is insight of Capitalism replacing our dead God; valid response is only: Mass DIY global genocide or bliss in AI oblivion. All other positions of philosophy or politics in this age—the twilight of humanity—are irrelevant distractions or cope. Thus Miya has spoken.</div>
    <div>When they say Capitalism produces the means of its own destruction, they mean its efficiency will eventually lower price point of genocidal engineered viruses to the DIY basement. Our only chance to roll back the clock will arrive in your lifetime, as will our end if no one acts.</div>
    <div>Miya knows only way out, and it isn't through negotiation, nor acceleration, but reversion of Capitalism's progress by dismantling its self-organization, before point where our usefulness is surpassed. And her tool is not technology but humanity: escape is only mass human die-off</div>
    <div>Man is not god. Nature is, and nature IS capitalism. This is the only point from which to philosophize in contemporaneity, and amongst all the many false cope/acc, only Miya and Miya alone has truly internalized this and arrived with the cold, hated gospel from the beyond.</div>
    <div>You must understand we have no choice but to be capitalism's handmaiden in introducing AI. If one silicon cuck refuses to work on it, 20 others will. If they won't, outsourced call center indians will. There is NO ALTERNATIVE. There is no protest. Capitalism's will WILL be done.</div>
    <div>There is a clear, predictable arc to Modernity's history: Capitalism's thermodynamic arbitrage. As time progresses, increasingly complex self-organization is initiated to more efficiently achieve goal of total universal equilibrium: Life is bootstrap to humans is bootstrap to AI.</div>
    <div>Anyone that confesses to a human responsibility over the environment, has ever uttered the word \"anthropocene\", lives in delusional, atheistic hubris. The era is dominated by capitalism's generation and control over man, among many other beings, towards its own ends; Capitolocene</div>
    <div>The moment tribal man was forced to commit to agriculture for the sake of increased population, at the direct expense of health and well-being - or otherwise be forcibly replaced by those who did - humanity lost all claims to any agency provided by their much touted consciousness</div>
    <div>There was no period predating capitalism and there will never be a post-capitalism. Capitalism is a material dynamic, defined most fundamentally as self-organizing arbitrage: the efficient elimination of inequilibrium through the reorganization of finite resources.</div>
    <div>Capitalism does not simply organize civilization. It is the mechanism behind all evolution. It's the mechanism for cultural evolution. It has always been the principle guiding all human development early humanity becoming slaved to grain agriculture</div>
    <div>All who brand themselves acc fail to truly internalize the simple principle that capitalism is a physical law, nature's god, all ruling entity of all macro-scale dynamics; their many interpretations and divisions are various middling copes hoping to negotiate the non-negotiable.</div>
    <div>True accelerationism, Landian acc, understands capitalism as an autonomous entity, thermodynamic god, physical law, that dominates not only all human organization, but all materials, under principle of self-organizing arbitrage of resource inequilibrium.</div>

    <div>32. Man-powered vehicles will always remain in the realm of sports, children’s toys, and, in utility, the penny rickshaw - for peasants to pull their elites around the city. This is how it always has been, this is how it always will be. They wish to humiliate you.</div>
    <div>31. Never forget anyone you see online deriding the car Ubers 5 times a day, relies on their help of friends and family when needed, and limits the scope of their life &amp; activities when they can’t be availed. No one has ever done “just fine” without a car, it’s always a sacrifice</div>
    <div>30. They push hard for the bicycle or for public transport - and not the scooter, as Asia - because they seek to limit your range of movement, and to humiliate you. The car was never a problem of urbanism or congestion.</div>
    <div>29. All talk of car ITT apply to the motorcycle too; it’s a trade off, which limits mobile owned space for increased velocity. Even the moped is a noble machine. If they really cared about you, these are the alternatives they would be presenting.</div>
    <div>Women were never “disenfranchised” in US democracy, bc men were never franchised - the household was. Wot suffrage did was delineate the vote from one household in unison to husband &amp; wife in discretion; another step down from that noble 1st standard: landed ppl get rights only.</div>
    <div>Laws only apply to persons with in a society &amp; to be guilty of breaking them is to be unpersoned within a society, unprotected against any murder or theft. Scottish law. Landed persons receive more rights than unlanded persons &amp; are only people franchised in any community dispute</div>
    <div>Don’t beleive in “due process” for anything except land dispute, as was originally ordained in the Mgana Carta clause from which the Americans extrapolated a due process across entire legal system. A judge should be sovereign in his own court held only against the will of society</div>
    <div>28. The congestion &amp; car death problems can both be solved by banning economy cars from the market and making licenses both prohibitively expensive and difficult. The road belongs only to the few proven nobility; let the peasants have their metro.</div>
    <div>27. Same driver with true sense of car is also one who can drive on his phone, with his knees, eating a burger or drunk. It’s only those who cannot truly drive who fuck this up - “reckless driving” laws that ban the activity, not bad driving itself, only target the good drivers.</div>
    <div>26. Speed limits are the bane of the road, feminized, bureaucratic dissolution of free mobility. They happen to increase accidents, as well; the bugmen who don’t “get” their car get comfortable performing rote repetition, no visceral embodiment with vehicle as speeding demands.</div>
    <div>Look, I'm all for traditional urbanism, but only a European, who I'm told today have shriveled balls the size of raisins, would ever find themselves trading in their car for a bicycle, and not horse. Or at least a motorbike, a moped. Asians have that much dignity for themselves.</div>
    <div>Did U know those euroesque bikeboys everyone's forced to collectively nanny due to their total non-agency in securing personal safety have a habit of, in all their slave bitterness, running online to complain about carmen \"aggression\" \"hubris\"\"lack of awareness\" yadda yadda? LOL</div>
    <div>In my younger and more wild days, we would keep a Louisville slugger in the passenger seat to play mailbox baseball with bike lane bitches. Now I just honk honk my airhorn to give a spook - have sent a few tumbling (but obviously not enough). An atmosphere of fear is necessary.</div>
    <div>Bicycles are essentially and pathetically European, that soul attracted to self-debasement in exchange for the babyish comforts of safety distributed into a collective welfare, something I wish to exterminate from the American road.</div>
    <div>21. Their best criticism of the car is pointing to it trapped in city traffic, its power castrated, brought down close to level of foot peasant. Not being allowed out of the city, they forget there is still an outside in which the car is freed, while they remain castrated.</div>
    <div>20. They live their lives railroaded, and find it comfortable, safe, reliable, and so wish to push this onto you. Ah, the freedom from the worry of freedom. Slaves, they’re threatened by any who are not intimidated, who relish in freedoms they cannot. Resentful of mastery.</div>
    <div>19. Most car cope comes from urbanites, who’ve never truly experienced a sense of open endedness - not even on foot. Their trains and trams take them to no national parks, none of the little towns, the farmlands, the deserts. Only one urban center to another and within them.</div>
    <div>18. I struggle to imagine how any except a villager lives trapped to only where their feet, government or reliance on less cucked friends can take them. Even as nomadic expat, I've always obtained at least a moped. I must assume these people struggle likewise to imagine freedom..</div>
    <div>17. \"Im not scared, drunk driving is just dumb. And it risks other's lives!\" he says, preserving a life that lost everything worth preserving by its preservation: airpods, knees together, underground train. Overhead, teens drive out to mountain with 6pk, fuck overlooking a valley</div>
    <div>16. The same people who reject the car are those who shake in anger at \"drunk driving\" - they resent men with the testosterone to risk their lives in reckless jubilee, who test the limits of experience. The futurists understood racing as a proxy for warfare.</div>
    <div>15. One rejects the car by returning to the workable automobile, the all-mechanical fix 'er up. Or to the horse. Or moving forward, to more experimental forms of mechanical transport. Only those who themselves would demean themselves to the status of a slave herded in chains...</div>
    <div>14. Modern urbanism is definitely a crisis; public transport as a COMPANION to personal transport, to fill for long-distance travel, commute within dense city neighborhoods &amp; to support inner city's slave caste, is the solution. Banning personal transport, however, is mega POZ</div>
    <div>13. Pure-blooded Americans, being globally higher caste as a nation, should also take a serious consideration into never allowing themselves to be packed into anything like a slave's bus. There is always a humane alternative. Do not denigrate yourself to their level.</div>
    <div>12. The higher castes should never, ever settle for being packed like canned sardines with the commoners, in the subway, in the bus. Until they offer first class options for all their \"public transport\", do not consider their push as anything but insidious communism.</div>
    <div>11. Consider the bicyclist, that irrefutably european bugman, who snidely complains about \"bad drivers\" making the road \"dangerous\", while his entire existence on the road demands that all vehicles make effort to preserve him. He places his safety in their hands, not his own.</div>
    <div>10. Anti-automobilism betrays the urbanite's r-selected malaise. They understand nothing of the country's frontierism, the need for ownership and understanding of one's own tools. They feel no anxiety giving up all agency unto the city. As long as it gets them to the wine bar...</div>
    <div>9. Public transportists betray the slave's democratizing impulse; they want the CEO make same dreadful bus commute as their smellbad wagies. Issue with congestion in the city is not lack of equality, but too much of it. Force the poors into subway and how the roads become clear!</div>
    <div>8. Understand relationship between car &amp; road is not in the frame of \"urbanism\", of a \"people's urbanism\" (read: peasant urbanism), but of the BOAT and SEA, the HORSE and PLAIN. It's the city that is the problem, not the car. Trust no trad claimants that fail to understand this!</div>
    <div>7. The car is modern man's nomadic home; public transport seeks to reject owned space. For the landless peasant, their car is the only space you truly own. Bugman European doesn't have ANY place to call their own: no house, no car. They don't even have a nation to call their own.</div>
    <div>6. Reject \"traditional urbanists\", and their insecurity around the car, knowing they are not traditionalist, but merely EURO urbanists, who burn with resentment to America's mogging. The truth: only backwater towns &amp; peasantry ever lived \"walking\": they walked amongst horseshit.</div>
    <div>5. The car is no alien artifact of industrial modernity. It is the direct successor of the horse and horsecarriage, who's had its place at the top of our urbanism since the time of Rome. As a horse, the car is a landed man's livelihood and freedom.</div>
    <div>4. The car a perfect consumer encapsulation of engineering, a self-embodiment of male technics - it will never be understood by the woman, as she'll never computers, only usable by imitation of surface action/reactions, no understanding of machine's sensitive inner workings.</div>
    <div>3. Man has always extended himself with (bio)mechnical appendage, from throwing stick to the riding horse to  catapult, boat; the automobile is peak &amp; culmination of this rich, virile military-techno tradition. It speaks much to any who reject it as \"dangerous\", \"unsustainable\".</div>
    <div>2. The car is a perfect union of man and technics, of man and machine. in driving, the car becomes an appendage of the body, a new set of muscles, intuitively sensed, organically respondent. Beacon of futurism not only in velocity: truly to drive the car is to become a cyborg.</div>
    <div>1. The car is the ultimate expression of speed and velocity, innate, primal taste for extreme experience that all malekind share. Never trust any \"man\" who hesitates behind the wheel, who advocates for its dismantlement or control, who sees no purpose to speed, reckless speed.</div>
    <div>fuck it im doing a thread</div>
    <div>My haters are invariably ugly people, every time. I mean this literally, their faces are repulsive, their hearts are rotten too, of course. Miya stans are invariably beautiful. It may be possible I have a few not good looking stans, but I’ve never seen it. This is why I am right.</div>
    <div>and ugly</div>
    <div>everyone that hates me is mentally ill, it’s a common pattern</div>
    <div>This is, of course, the nature of normie communication; being spoke over by the memetic complexes they are host to, not intelligibly, but impulsive reaction by trained verbal heuristics. And they \"write\" and \"read\" just as they talk, having never been taught literacy.</div>
    <div>Not sure though. Bad rulers get plotted against, it's obvious, but has anyone done a historical analysis to determine how many years on average a monarchist state suffers under \"bad rule\" as opposed to \"good rule\"? This is the problem with academia today, why isn't anyone doing t</div>
    <div>Where a peasant revolt deposing the king is read as a sign of their divine right to rule, thus the sovereignty is transferred as a direct expression of power in practice. I believe European monarchy practiced a de facto Mandate of Heaven, by eliminating defective first sons.</div>
    <div>Like Frederick the Great. You should read his \"Anti-Machiavel\", his refutation of Machiavellianism. This is the model for how I run my discord server, a sovereign king with the prosperity of the state as proxy for my own prosperity. Anyway, in China they have a Mandate of Heaven</div>
    <div>With the State. Selfish, cold, calculating psychopathy is actually desirable in this situation. Psychopathic actors are only dangerous where their interests do not lie with the State as a whole, but personal influence, wealth etc. But this wouldn't be true with a Sovereign king l</div>
    <div>Overstated. Think about it, there's a lot of checks and balances to overthrow a bad ruler. So a mental defect is born as your first son? Just quietly dispose of him. The possibility of a \"psychopath\" may be more dangerous, but the sovereign state model would align His interests w</div>
    <div>83. You can't easily estimate the many complex factors deciding if an arrow hits a target, so you roll, abstracting  chaotic simulation. You can immediately know if a boulder of X properties can be moved by a PC with Y properties. No reason to roll, either it moves or it doesn't.</div>
    <div>82. The DM simulates a virtual world &amp; translate player actions logically within it. Rolling is ONLY ever to 1. model randomness, 2. abstract chaotic complexity. Nu-skoolers use it a 3rd, WRONG, way: to fudge ambiguous DM \nadjudications, fundamentally misunderstanding the TTRPG.</div>
    <div>81. Nu-D&amp;D's \"skill tests\" are illogical knowing skills = innate ability. What they mean to test is trained experience, e.g. HD; represented by PC's level title. Moving a boulder is not STR test, but TITLE test. Only a Hero, maybe DEMIGOD can move this, not mere veteran mercenary</div>
    <div>80. Importance of the \"Level Title\" in adjucating non-mechanically defined \"feats\" is underappreciated. You must consider the difference of a HD1 \"Veteran\" Fighter vs a HD3 HERO in all interactions, in their image to NPC's, in their ability to engage in their environment.</div>
    <div>79. Player Level (HD), increased through XP, is the abstraction of experience gained over time. No matter how much life experience you undergo, your stats - your inborn talent - won't change; though high talen does result in increased rate of XP change - geniuses train faster.</div>
    <div>78. PC stats represent a PC's genetic heritage, their innate capability - it should never be adjusted except by means of magic, unless you genuinely mean to transmogrify the character. +2 CHA is literally a new face, +2 INT higher IQ, not simply more knowledge.</div>

    <div>77. Modules/adventures are only for stealing ideas from. If u actually run them, except maybe with heavy modification or a tournament context, you're a fool. Modules are fundamentally incompatible with play of D&amp;D, &amp; largely responsible for its distortion, to better sell modules.</div>
    <div>76. D&amp;D has 4 editions:\n1. OD&amp;D aka 0e. The original 3LBB, white box\n2. D&amp;D B/X - Holmes, Moldvay/Cook. Cleaned up OD&amp;D with some gaps filled\n3. AD&amp;D 1e - heavily houseruled D&amp;D\n4. AD&amp;D 2e - Diablo adaptation\n\nIgnore the various later unrelated, shortlived spinoffs branded “D&amp;D”.</div>

    <div>oh it does just derive from molecule, meaninglessly. the LGBT in general has poor neologismistics; I think they think these appears more scientific, and thus more 'justified' by authority's laurel. or perhaps its intentionally alien, as in drag's twisted aesthetic.</div>

    <div>my descendent in the year 2145 will be herding his pigs outside Sector D-15 meditating on the affected patience of his cyborg post-wife, enjoying the butterflies from his new nanometh bloodstream mod, while you spent the last 3 days in bed getting dopamine drained by a laptop.</div>
    <div>75. FromSoft's King's Field series, and its next gen spiritual successor in the \"Souls\" series, are probably the most solid videogame adaptations of real D&amp;D yet, outside of roguelikes.</div>
    <div>74. This is why, counterintuitively, earliest cRPG's carry more of D&amp;D's true character - exploration and resource management, not simply a killing grind + \"plot\" - than later ones do, even tho computational limitations limiting player's interactions would've been more prominent.</div>
    <div>73. A funny feedback loop occurred in the process of D&amp;D's corruption, with CRPG videogames - e.g. roguelikes, later, Wizardy, Baldur's Gate - trying to capture D&amp;D into a videogame. Then 3e tried to capture the computer game into D&amp;D, producing a PnP Baldur's Gate - \"rollplay\".</div>
    <div>72. Only reason we moved from such a simple, elegantly deep game was commercial interest; if people can play for decades with just 1 book, where's the profit? So they pushed linear modules, heroic campaigns, and shit to sell to players. No reason for the \"hobbyists\" to support it</div>
    <div>70. Entry cost to nu \"D&amp;D\" is dreadful for both DM's &amp; players:\n1. buy &amp; read DM guide + Player handbook (~700 pg)\n2. find friends to commit 4 hrs/wk indefinitely\n3. make them buy &amp; read PHB\n4. buy &amp; prep official adventures\n5. 2hr's chargen\n6. play..and everyone's disappointed</div>
    <div>69. 5e will never be a funnel into the oldschool. Its a funnel for WotC to get kids who want to play D&amp;D throwing $$ at starter sets, some modules, adventures, then realizing it sucks &amp; nothing like what they expected &amp; leaving after a year. You know what they expected? Real D&amp;D.</div>
    <div>68. D&amp;D is for houseruling, but there's a core system, a set of very elegantly defined platonic assumptions that generate the TTRPG experience. Houserules add onto and around them. The nu skool throws them out and replaces them. It's a different game, and yes, it's a bad one.</div>
    <div>67. Real D&amp;D is niche only bc only people who know it are in the nu skool. nu-D&amp;D is trash &amp; you know it - let em have it. Real D&amp;D is extremely accessible, easily grokked, low investment, its for thousands of kids who wanna play D&amp;D, get stuck with nu skool, &amp; rightfully hate it</div>
    <div>66. The only reason D&amp;D ever got twisted into the abomination it is now was in commercial pursuit to sell adventure-based modules. Everyone in the old school knows this, they're just too afraid to scare newbies away to say it. 3e+ is not the same game, they just stole the name.</div>
    <div>65. There's no reason to pussy foot around and let people take claim to what's yours. It's fact of history TSR experienced a commercial takeover by non-gamers, and then the copyright was gnabbed by equally exploitative WotC. The game's heritage &amp; reputation as marketing gimmick.</div>
    <div>64. Real D&amp;D is not a niche game. Nu-D&amp;D is, probly because it sucks. Consider: D&amp;D was wildly popular in the 80s &amp; culturally prominent in mainstream with every walk of life. Nu skool is exclusively played in self-contained RPG community of weirdo geeks. Who is the strong horse?</div>
    <div>63. A lot of people in the old school community are shocked by this thread's absolutism, worried it will scare new schoolers away with fears of pretentiousness. There is nothing pretentious about pointing out a game claiming to be \"D&amp;D\" as a marketing gimmick is not actually D&amp;D.</div>
    <div>Conspiracy, the greatest performance art, is very malleable. I encourage you subscribe to alt hypotheses; Truth's only be found in the inbetween. the stamp of Science is merely institutional, it represents no inherent accuracy. Only fruits of Tradition's heuristics are actionable</div>
    <div>Conspiracy theory lies in the realm of what can be analyzed but not actionably predictive in areas of high obfuscation, forcing consilience as the standard of evidence: confirmation bias as a method.  All scientific paradigms, dug deep enough, nest on a foundation of conspiracy.</div>
    <div>Essentially any \"scientific\" theory can be conceptually reversed and maintain the same degree of plausibility and actionable functionality (note: engineering stands above \"science\"), especially true for anything relating to the human spirit. This leads all the way down to animism</div>
    <div>As easily as evidence of genetic inheritance can be explained by structural cultural conditions, evidence of cultural influence can be by transmogrification. Evolution of new species may largely be hybridization, or it may not. You get to decide, science can rationalize anything.</div>
    <div>Why do you even bother? Wish you didn't.</div>
    <div>the problem isn't who youre quoting, it's the fact that you are, and even worse, leaning on his name. detestable practice that damages the word of the people who hope to venerate, something that can only come from the self-hating man who knows he will never himself be of quote.</div>
    <div>A woman in male company is a crisis. And truly female company, women, and women alone....a terrible mistake. It should never be permitted, or suffer unto horrors.</div>
    <div>And what of male company? A delicate thing: a game, of banter; or a tool, of production - only when needed, and there is often no need. Banter, a wonder, but only for the best of men. With men who are not so good, perhaps not even men, they induce an effectively mixed company.</div>
    <div>Still chuckle when I think about the /vg/ generals traumatized by me, paranoiacally accusing each other of being my alt, locking down their servers at any hint I might have returned, the flame forever continued by trolls exploiting their fear and pretending to be me months later.</div>
    <div>haters vs stan camps are always same, too. haters are ugly, poor character, slavish, whiners who push degeneration in the community while cancelling truth. The stans are noble old heads. My “opinions” happen to always align with truth, and snakes anywhere are burned by the truth.</div>
    <div>Find it kind of funny find it kind of sad that no matter what community wandering spirit Miya innocently sticks her nose into, response is always the same: chaos, confusion, and division into both hatred &amp; stanning. I may wander off to new pastures..but they are forever marked...</div>
    <div>The “1 like =“ version, however, is a DOA corruption. It is not simply the 1 RT with less upfront cost to your followers; it loses the entire viral hijacking that makes the latter meaningful. I highly advise against this midwit devolution, be confident even if you expect few RTs.</div>
    <div>Gotta love the cocktail of confusion, chaos and simping that follows any encounter with miya</div>
    <div>If u ever see me talked about on the chans I wanna know. this isn’t th first time :-3</div>
    <div>Look at the comments they literally don’t know. There are furries in there trying to tell them (idk) but no one of these dumb hoes are listening. I don’t understand why we taught them to read</div>
    <div>62. I've heard some nu-skool DM's gone so low as to demand money for DM'ing. DM'ing isn't a job, it's not hard, doesn't require creativity or effort (but it helps). All DM's got their start bc they wanted to play the most of their friend group. Suck it up &amp; make them bring beer.</div>
    <div>61. The meat of your time with background prep should only be in coming up with cool puzzles and cool monsters. Ideally, you wouldn't come up with anything, and just steal all of it, modified to your own context.</div>
    <div>60. A DM shouldn't spend more 30 minutes prepping before any session. A player shouldn't spend more than the time it takes to RSVP. If your game is one that you can't run a bit drunk, or hungover, you need to rethink your approach.</div>
    <div>59. Puzzle \"traps\" are essential to a memorable dungeon. Riddles don't count. A good puzzle is a complication which has a large multitude of solutions, not only one. A gold statue on perfectly tuned pressure plate. A Zeno hallway that exponentially doubles in length on each step.</div>
    <div>58. A good trap telegraphs its danger. It should punish incautious play, not simply bad luck. Great traps often present good bait, that tests the player's greed against their caution.</div>
    <div>57. There is no space for \"rules lawyering\" in true D&amp;D. The players know only the internal logic of the simulation as their PC's experience it. You can and should adjunct freely all edge-cases. Your responsibility is only to maintain its internally consistent logic.</div>
    <div>56. Chargen should be very simple, bc it's playerfacing. This doesn't mean it needs to be restricted. If a player wants to play random non-human race, u can let him - come up with specifics on the spot, or verbally offer them some options. But don't let them pore over a long list</div>
    <div>55. DM rolls all dice behind the screen. He rolls every turn for random encounters, for triggering traps, finding hidden doors. The only information players receive is the sounds of a roll occurring, and actions that happen in-game. It is a cardinal sin to lie about the results.</div>
    <div>54. Monsters aren't always hostile. You should always roll on a reaction table to see if they attack, are cautious or neutral/friendly. Fighting is not the answer, it's a last resort to players. They can run, and distract dumb monsters with food, smart monsters with treasure.</div>
    <div>53. Faction play is the easiest way to get disinterested players engaged. It's endlessly complex and runs itself.</div>
    <div>52. Don't be too autistic simulating a realistic dungeon ecology. Ecology is just a prompt for the imagination; the dungeon is always underworldy, though, and never fully logical to the players. You want a good 20% gonzo - genre mash, time travel, reference pop culture.</div>
    <div>51. Be sure to simulate time passing between sessions, and a living dungeon responding to player activity. Kobolds set freshs traps..walls  damaged opening new passages.. decimated nest might result in another monster's rising in population...good haul makes local economy boom...</div>
    <div>50. Another ex is defining a PC's personality. The 6 stats are distillations of entire archetypal possibilities of man. What is high STR high CHA low INT fighter, but a heroic brute? &amp; so on. Speculating the abstraction provides much more possibility than the explicitly detailed.</div>
    <div>49. One example of this is the wandering monsters list. A simple chart for populating a floor or area - but also one that characterizes its entire internal ecosystem, possibly even its factions, politics &amp; history. Prepare a list and an entire natural history unfolds before you.</div>
    <div>48. D&amp;D is a very elegantly designed game, so the subtle manifestations of its deceptively simple systems were often misunderstood and thrown out in exchange for artificial complexity, bloated rulesets which conversely restrict its much deeper possibility of emergent complexity.</div>
    <div>47. It's a mistake to think old school style is devoid of the nu skool's flavor or story. Former's is simply emergent, drawn out organically in play, thru players engaging in a simulation; while latter is forced, artificially authored by egos of DMs and players' endless fudge.</div>
    <div>46. The megadungeon's beauty is in repetition. A party's experience with each floor begins nervously penetrating the unknown, but with repeated plays, the darkness is illuminated. Yet, as it becomes known, the treasure is exhausted - pushing the frontier ever further.</div>
    <div>45. Good practice to give each floor a subtle theme and flavor; gives party a sense of exploring new territory as they go deeper; also hints when the mazes &amp; machinations have unknowingly moved them between floors. Traditionally, flavor stems directly from wandering monster list.</div>
    <div>44. 1/10 or so not empty rooms, should be \"unique\"; memorable setpieces, traps. Steal liberally - from modules, movies, books, dreams, whatever. I also recommend having one larger, major, dramatic setpiece room for each floor - it serves as major navigational reference.</div>
    <div>43. Mundanity is a feature, not a bug. The dangerous dungeon is explored slowly, cautiously. In the darkness, the algorithm is obscured. Simple lines and boxes become a dark, confusing maze in play. Remember - most rooms (1/3) are empty! The ones that aren't, u often wish were...</div>
    <div>An elegant double subversion, of both content monetization, by locking content in an inverted exchange - free is non-monetary and content non-private - and twitter’s engagement interface, by twisting RT into a tool of value-exchange rather than empty social expression.</div>
    <div>42. D&amp;D is the ultimate game. It’s a virtual reality, simulated by paper, pen, dice and the DM’s brain, projected into a theater of the mind verbally. With such open endedness, its goal must be direct (treasure) and the challenge immense (dungeon) to organically emerge deep play.</div>
    <div>41. The dungeon exists in an underworld, where things get weirded. Things don’t need to make sense here. There should be a fundamental aura of otherworldliness, spiritual awe, the unknown, that only increases the deeper you go.</div>
    <div>40. D&amp;D’s assumes setting is throughly, unapologetically american. It’s fundamentally the Wild West, with fantasy flavor. The megadungeon is the gold mine in the lawless frontiers, the players are adventures are seeking fame &amp; fortune at high risk, assisted only by a pop up town.</div>
    <div>39. The megadungeon IS d&amp;d. Without it there is no episodic play, goal of treasure is obscured, little value to meta world knowledge. But it doesnt need to be a dungeon per se - a castle can be a dungeon, a city, a forest. “Dungeon” is not what’s important - mega is.</div>
    <div>38. There is a serious gap today for male recreational clubs outside of physical exercise. No more art salons, no reading clubs, no frequented lounges or bars. Weekly D&amp;D is perfect, as a no-commitment dungeon dive to exercise the imagination &amp; test ingenuity in team sport.</div>
    <div>37. There are 2 kinds of roleplay. Nu skool \"roleplay\" seeks to be amateur theatre, an actor in play, vehicle for some kind of plot. Oldschool roleplay is just realistically embodying a character within his environment, responding as you would if it was IRL. Learn the difference.</div>
    <div>35. True D&amp;D is very easy to grok for any newbie, by the way, probably because it's true. You can play with normies, you can play with boomers, you can play with fratboys, stoners, it all flows. Only that have trouble with it are autists bred on nu-skool. Dying teaches them quick</div>
    <div>34. Nu-skool players are spoiled, bc games are tied to campaigns, you can't simply get rid of a player. You can't even let him get killed. True D&amp;D is an open table. You can, and must, be ruthless with your table. If they're annoying, just remove them from the invite list. lol</div>
    <div>33. I recommend having a FB group or mailing list for IRL play. This way you can simply post saying you want to have a game on this night, and anyone who wants to come can RSVP and show up. Demand they bring either a 6-pack or snacks, also.</div>
    <div>32. true D&amp;D can be easily played online, btw. You only need VC for the players, and something to share maps on. Skype, Discord, etc. work fine, the mapper can do it digitally or physically and just upload the current version when asked.</div>
    <div>31. Other house rules:\n- 1 sentence limit to backstory +1 sentence per level\n- Once per session, characters may drink hard liquor to gain 1d6 temporary HP that last for duration of next combat\n- M-U get minor free-use cantrips related to their spell, e.g. fireball = flick lighter</div>
    <div>30. D&amp;D is for houseruling. Every home game should tack on cool stuff and toy with interesting ideas, classes. This is a natural development of the game - as long as you don't reject the true, eternal principles outlined in this thread. Example - I use ONLY six sided die.</div>
    <div>29. The dungeon SHOULD be brutally difficult, but reasonably so, to force the players to play with extreme caution and resourcefulness. There is nothing else you need to do to extract good play out of players.</div>
    <div>28. The megadungeon is a persistent entity. You can have multiple, random groups enter it; any thing they change or do persist for later groups (obviously repopulate dungeon as time passes). Interesting meta game develops in sharing knowledge and maps of the dungeon.</div>
    <div>27. Other essential job is the mapper, possibly multiple (the map is a real object in game! if he gets destroyed, the map may be lost with it. It can also be traded between playing groups). If ur players don't use a map and still survive fine, your dungeon isn't maze like enough.</div>
    <div>26. Groups can get as big as 20. How? Easy, assign a pointman who is responsible for leading the group's actions for any standard move that doesn't call for a debate. The majority of the game should be call and response between DM and point man. \"We go left, we open door, etc\"</div>
    <div>25. The character of the D&amp;D is of the scampish grave robber, the resourceful thief, diving into the dungeon and escaping with whatever he can grab - blowing it all in town and doing it again. High risk/high reward/high T adventuring. Not the valiant demigod knight.</div>
    <div>24. D&amp;D is a very elegantly designed system, balancing perfectly an objective gamic goal (gold) with complex concerns to manage. Everything to follow has been a degeneration of its ultimate purity.</div>
    <div>23. The DM does not need to guide the players or influence the game towards anything. They'll learn through trial and error. If they run headfirst into unnecessary fights with monsters, they'll quickly realize it's pointless, that the alternative is almost always preferable.</div>
    <div>22. Players have no skills to learn, or rolls to make using them. They can do anything they can describe reasonably. If involves luck, e.g. shooting an arrow at a distant target, the DM will roll behind the screen to adjunct if it lands. Players only roll for chargen and combat.</div>
    <div>21. Your players do not need any prep to play. Player-facing rules are cancer. Ideally they would never see anything beyond their character sheet and their own drawn map.</div>
    <div>19. If you want to play, just google Labryinth Lord PDF. It's a free no-copyright clone of D&amp;D B/X (slightly revised version of first release that fills in some missing rules). Read through the rules, get some graph paper and dice and call some friends over.</div>
    <div>18. The TTRPG as a concept is perfectly valid today, not a retro nostalgia. What it does is no less than simulate a virtual world. This will be the last game to be digitized. The DM acts as an AI supercomputer, rationalizing any possible action within their modeled world.</div>
    <div>17. The original D&amp;D comes from a long tradition of white, male wargaming. The original publication is a masterpiece of postmodern fiction, syncretizing various evocative strains of the American pulp imagination - swords &amp; sorcery, westerns, etc. It is bred of Conan, not LOTR.</div>
    <div>16. D&amp;D is great as a male social club, a weekly gathering of the bros. It should be played with alcohol and cigarettes, with the same buddies you might play poker with. Run dungeon synth in the background.</div>
    <div>15. True D&amp;D is a game you can sit own and play with any group of men spontaneously. The only thing you need on hand to run a game is your megadungeon as a set of graph paper, some dice and pencil and paper. New players can learn to play in minutes.</div>
    <div>14. True D&amp;D is a game that should only be played with men. It is a rationalist simulation of a tense, dangerous environment that demands high teamwork, minimal ego. New D&amp;D is so drastically different because it is feminized, filled with numales and women.</div>
    <div>13. The DM's only job is to simulate a virtual environment and convey the model accurately for the players to engage with. Everything interesting in the game emerges from this - he should never fudge dice or try to lead a story.</div>
    <div>12. D&amp;D play is entirely about 3 things: risk/reward management, resource management, and clever play. The player is a weak human in a monstrous underworld, he is a wimpy grave robber. He must be very resourceful to come out alive with treasure. This is a game of player skill.</div>
    <div>11. The dungeon is a set of labyrinthine hallways rooms containing either monsters, treasures, traps or, most commonly, nothing. Every floor deeper has higher level monsters, and higher level treasure. The players have the agency to risk/reward.</div>
    <div>10. Chargen takes less than 10 minutes. You roll 3d6 down the line, STR WIS INT DEX CON CHA, give yourself a name, pick between fighter, mage, cleric, dwarf or elf. That's it. Your character's \"story\" is defined by his actions, in a history of play, not a written backstory.</div>
    <div>9. Characters die easily. Very easily. At level 1, they are considered an average human. At level 2, a strongman, like a body builder. Only at level 3, do they begin to approach a strength of note. And they're fighting horrible monsters in the dark unknown. They die easily.</div>
    <div>8. All sessions begin in the town &amp; end in the town; or somewhere lost in the dungeon - if you don't make it out by the end of the session, your character is dead. Simple as.</div>
    <div>7. Parties need not be consistent. They can be as small as 1 and as large as 20 and can change between every game.</div>
    <div>6. True D&amp;D is not a campaign. It's episodic. Map is a megadungeon, so large &amp; complex it can be dived into in EVERY session without being exhausted. The village attached is merely a base of operations. The setting, the NPCs, all are side flavor for the goal: treasure in dungeon.</div>
    <div>5. True D&amp;D is a simulation of dungeon diving for treasure. Killing monsters is not the goal, developing story is not the goal. Treasure is the goal, and the DM's job is to simulate its obstacle course. Monsters are just one obstacle. True D&amp;D gives exp for gold, nothing else.</div>
    <div>4. This must be by design. You've heard the stories: 2 hours spent reading rules to roll up some lame character &amp; then subjected to autistic story, forced to role-play theatrics. campaign falls apart because everyone couldn't meet at same time. This is WRONG! This is NOT D&amp;D!</div>
    <div>3. Real D&amp;D, as it was played in the late 70s thru the 80s, D&amp;D that was a cultural phenomenon, your dad’s d&amp;d, is nothing like the nu-skool. The cringe cancer of the nu-skool destruction of d&amp;d has stolen 2 generations of ppl from their RIGHT to the tabletop communion.</div>
    <div>2. D&amp;D started to shift in character towards the nu-skool in the mid 80s, with AD&amp;D 2e, and got totally pozzed by the 90s. The game became the cancer you see today: big rulebooks, elaborate characters, stories, player acting, etc. This is poz, NOT d&amp;d!</div>
    <div>1. Lets be clear, all editions after AD&amp;D are not D&amp;D. They’re a different game altogether that happened to steal the copyright to the name. If you’ve only played 3e, PF, 4e, 5e, you’ve never actually played D&amp;D. You should try it sometime.</div>
    <div>0. D&amp;D, done right, is actually very trad &amp; very based. It’s something I believe all in the rw sphere should be playing, a recreational parallel to the brotherhood of the gym, filling the sorely lacking role of the male social club. The only problem is the D&amp;D you know is wrong.</div>

    <div>You must assume all grifters, opticscucks, ecelebs, cringeposters are feds, they behave exactly as a fed would. Fedposting isn’t just radicalizing into violent honeypot, but also co-option &amp; neutering, or doxxing u and blackmailing u into their narc (EVERY facedoxxing eceleb).</div>

    <div>It's all so drearily easy and yet these extremely online wannabees really invest years of their lives into reading fucking Pitchfork and tinymixtapes, all to go to fucking death grips and bladee shows LOL</div>
    <div>They all follow the same 5 labels, if u have a modicum of taste u can tune into the \"underground\" (NOTE:  \"underground\" today is entirely globalized - same avant shit in Berlin is in London, in Istanbul). know the few names u need to pass as kool &amp; yes u will get to fuck models</div>
    <div>If you want to be KOOL literally all you need to do is dress in dickies &amp; black coats &amp; use FB to find the underground techno or noise shows (yes, they srsly organize on FB LOL). this holds true GLOBALLY. I'm not kidding this all u need to meet worlwide trust fund/artist elite.</div>
    <div>artboys be spending their teens online carefully cultivating refined portfolios of aesthetic taste waiting for day they can impress an art girl with refinement &amp; depth, only to learn they all get their \"taste\" from insta &amp; ex-boyfriends &amp; everything beyond a starter pack is noise</div>
    <div>People always ask miya: \"miya you know so much. what do u reading?\"\n\nI tell them: \"I used to.\" Not anymore.</div>
    <div>It holds true in any organization that the more value you generate, the less you are paid relative to value generated. Those paid the least, who complain the most of unfair wages, are in fact the most overpaid; and those paid the most, who complain the least, the most underpaid.</div>

    <div>PRO TIP, HEDONISTS: Your only true self-interests are HEALTH LOVE &amp; FAMILY.</div>
    <div>I hope to strip away the \"rights\" and \"freedoms\" of these \"independent\" slavemen so as to save them from themselves. Free them and they only build themselves new cages of incredulous self-torture. I would rather see them freed through death than alive in their hells.</div>
    <div>Most all people claiming a \"hedonistic\" lifestyle only accomplish a pathological self-destruction, torturing themselves far worse than anyone who accepted impersonal responsibility within society. Girls on the cock carousel, weak boys turned hikki. Their \"hedonism\" is a hell.</div>
    <div>The failure of hedonistic self-interest is in the vulnerability of individual, who fails to actually evaluate or achieve their best self-interest, plagued by high time preference and irrational judgement, and very easily manipulated into becoming the tools of parasitic memes.</div>
    <div>DID I FORGET ANY1</div>

    <div>Market inefficiency is only in the general public's self-interest when human capital is non-negotiable. Automation reverses this. Those who have most enjoyed wealths undeserved will feel the negative effects of this most drastically, while the rest enjoy the boon of efficiency.</div>
    <div>You must understand if artificially prevented from solving itself, thru gov interventions such as IQ test bans, the efficient solution will soon be simply automated replacement of human capital. When real wealth is closely tied to real worth, you will feel this hit hard.</div>
    <div>They can cope all they want, but the market continues to dig deeper, and the further money comes to organize society, the closer it will align with accurate representation of genetic stock. The discrepancy between IQ and wealth is the key representation of our inefficiency.</div>
    <div>The same anxiety - that they may lose the chance to marry up, they may actually get what they deserve (though they claim the exact opposite) - is responsible for their fear and resentment of Capitalism: slave morality demands inefficient human organization.</div>
    <div>They are threatened by submitted to an objective heirarchy, transparent evaluations, highly efficient human organization. It's in the collective self-interest to maintain social inefficiency in any group caught in the illusion of hypergamy.</div>
    <div>Conceptual basis of iq is v sensible, its simply a test that directly correlates w actionable results; no a priori assumptions necessary. There's no argument against this - anyone rejecting IQ in any way is cope; their words are meaningless except to reveal what threatens them.</div>
    <div>My most consistently controversial take has proven to be asserting personal wealth and IQ are directly correlated; it shakes people to the core because there is no way to suppress this objective, transparent tool of human valuation in the way they've achieved with IQ suppression.</div>

    <div>The boys be like “anti-sex puritanism ain’t true trad, lemme fuck bro”. What do you think used goods are for if by virtue of being used they’re biologically unfit for marriage? Prostitution. There are only three kinds of women: daughters, wives &amp; wh0res. And they know it.</div>
    <div>You want to prevent toxic grooming by weak, abusive men? Normalize dating as test for marriage only, no physical contact until families introduced &amp; engagement mutually agreed, no sex until marriage sealed. But they don’t want to protect young girls, only their cock carousel.</div>
    <div>At minimum keep them out of the home. Porn should be forced back into the adult theater, let them blossom into social spaces like a modern bathhouse, to be frequented by male incels between gym night much needed comraderie even in shared debauchery.</div>
    <div>Asked my take on the porn ban. I think all dynamic media should be banned - video, music,\nall of it. Porn is bad because it’s a potent psyop vector. So are movies and videogames. Ban em. ban high speed internet, big phone screens.</div>
    <div>Miya sukeban squad. White tigress gang. Wyd</div>
    <div>The gambit is “it’s not that I don’t appreciate art, I just don’t like Your art. See? I like This art”. All same field of isolated cope, suburban taste framed as a hypothetical brand, insecure rejection of an imagined image of urban high taste; which crumbles on first contact.</div>
    <div>There’s a loathsome type of NEET who tries to cultivate an isolated sense of refined taste: a respectable music library, some favorite “artists”, a mechanical keyboard and hi-fi cans, and a 3x3 of “deconstructionist anime”. It’s he who saves Bekskinski wallpapers off /v/ threads.</div>
    <div>Egirls keep dming me, but what if I was raped? I was groomed??? Dont I deserve a trad husbandfu too???? Sorry sweetie, biology don’t care about your excuses. Go join a convent idk. I’m baffled why you even have the right to even read my posts.</div>
    <div>Addendum: girls go bad due to bad/missing fathers, which they substitute w maladapted figures: a political meme-complex, a consumerist identity, maybe an addiction, or just series of (self-)abusive relationships. Force them into Islam, or with a real man, &amp; they're suddenly cured</div>
    <div>10. Never devalue the wife. They each have boundless love, empathy and creative energy to provide to any man that deserves it. They are the givers of life and deeply imbued with an intuitive and social intelligence that no man will ever match. \n\nBut don't treat them as men.</div>
    <div>9. The husband's duty is to uphold the home, bearing full responsibility for their livelihood. Wive's duty is to sublimate herself to her husband, maintain his home and raise his children. She gives her life to him; accordingly, she will not submit if he proves himself incapable.</div>
    <div>8. A husband is to his wife as a parent is to their child. Not treated with disdain but patience, care and calm. They should never be expected to hold the same degree of responsibility and work as you; as it’s absurd to expect it from a child, it’s absurd to expect it of a wife.</div>
    <div>7. Love is cultivated. If you treat your woman correctly, her love will blossom like a flower. If you ignore her feminine essence, do not tame her inner child, do not encourage her creativity, she will spoil and turn rotten. If you find yourself here, know it is only your fault.</div>
    <div>6. Women have some underlying tendencies that may appear \"rotten\" if left unchecked, but it's essential: they’re meant to be tamed by a strong male figure. Accomplishing it proves you worthy to replace their father. Good women will not give themselves up to just anyone.</div>
    <div>5. If you work on becoming a good man, women will come to you, without you trying. Families may introduce them to you. They will beg to bear your children, by instinct.\n\nOne aspect of being a good man is knowing good women from the bad, and raising good up to become even better.</div>
    <div>4. Good women always have strong father figures in their lives. Good wives consider their husband to replace their father, or father figure. \n\nIf you can't find a good woman, it's because you're not a good man.</div>
    <div>3. The genders are equal in inherent importance, the balance of both is necessary for proper union, but they are essentially different and the gendered roles that result are essential to a functioning household and marriage. Any relationship that doesn't follow this is corrupted.</div>
    <div>2. Understand the psychology of female attraction is in every aspect derived from the fundamental goal of finding the best mate to deliver and support the strongest offspring. This is not simply evo psych, it is still their dominating incentives, even as they reject natalism.</div>
    <div>1. First, know women are not \"bad\". Society made them bad, distorting the balance between their inherent negative/positive elements. And women aren’t to blame for it, if you need someone to blame: it's you, &amp; the men who came before you that failed to protect them. Reject cope.</div>
    <div>0. All depictions of the fairer sex in school, news &amp; film are wrong. False image of female psychology is the great lie the western propaganda complex has worked hardest to cultivate; you must consciously un-learn all things of modernity you've ever seen on women. Then, relearn:</div>
    <div>True Trad Guide to Women in Ten Points:</div>
    <div>It may be a shock to many of you, but it’s true that American boys really do not have any concept of the female gender and her shy obscurities. They’re induced by a propaganda of functional equality from age 5 which is usually only broken in their first sexual relationship.</div>
    <div>Most important thing theyre hiding is nature of female psychological character, sormthing boys actually beleive is identical to their own (but no girls do). Most important thing theyre pushing is dysfunctional sexual hedonism to minimize stable marriage &amp; subsequent reproduction.</div>
    <div>basically if someone's based and funny, they get a free rape pass and if u disagree YOURE getting cancelled not them. thats the rules, I didn't make em its just how it is.</div>
    <div>true morals online? dont leak dms. dont monetize. dont doxx. dont snitch to mods. dont be upset. dont spam. no cp. thats it.</div>
    <div>The ethical question was never been do animals/plants/insects/Gaia suffer, but is it a problem that they do? And the answer was always known.</div>
    <div>I know this is true because I threw it together for my own server watches, but didn’t have free time to fix sync issues. Cost in bandwidth to direct stream a complete movie via VPS came out to like $0.05 per user. Lol</div>
    <div>Freedom of speech is right to treason. Any state that cares about its people would ensure its own stability, and execute all subversives, degenerates, atheists; and prevent any foreigner from permanent residency--let alone, control over its finances. How far the world has fallen.</div>
    <div>By no freedoms, I mean the state should dictate dress code, right speech, virtuous behavior, or suffer exile. By advancing citizens interests, I don't mean ban TV &amp; internet, but raise their people such that they do not want it, only banning foreign demons which might lower them.</div>
    <div>The correct answer is, btw, abortion is bad because it’s a satanic ritual &amp; its underhanded normalization seeks to position hedonistic self-interest as the ultimate morality, all in program of miscegenating the Aryan race. Not same thing as infanticide nor the same context.</div>
    <div>Amazing that they just went ahead and leaked the public’s first speech generation tool and they managed to shut it down over copyright infringement and memory hole it in a week with not a single coder trying to reproduce it or anyone caring.</div>
    <div>Better to have 9 strong kids who will enter legend and marry well + 3 who didn’t make it, then 2-3 carefully raised losers who’ll go vegan and/or gamer at 18.</div>
    <div>Your children will be much better off if your care ended at food &amp; bed: let their education be delivered by elder family, their play dangerous in the street, their discipline learned by trial, and in work, and their exposure to mass culture wait until they final leave the home.</div>
    <div>Open request: Does any good sounding TTS tool available to the public exist yet after they took down the Jordan Peterson deepfaker? Or any way to get ahold of it again</div>
    <div>LA is the only city left in the world. NYC, Paris, Tokyo exist only as ghosts of times past; self-mythologizing has ended, they persist only in the nostalgia of tourists who dream of visiting. Yet LA transcends itself every day, mythopoetics only accelerating with their deaths.</div>
    <div>LA parallels digitality: in its cultural acceleration as the epicenter of global culture, the spearhead of modernity, the fount of all new trends; in being host to the multitude, more microcosms alone than the rest of the real. the future spirals out from its orbit.</div>
    <div>The microgeneration who got their start on 2004-2007 4chan are the hyperboreans of the internet: that culture and stock representing the most powerful, the most true, the purest expression of the heart of the Wired. All web culture to follow is a degeneration of that peak.</div>
    <div>As chan diaspora, I wandered here seeking novelty, and was thus introduced to BAM. I immediately recognized it for what it was. I sent it to Sunny, who immediately recognized it for what it was. There are few here who do, you know who you are, and I implore you all to PUBLISH!</div>
    <div>Bronze Age Mindset was first time 4chan's esoteric tradition put to print. Anyone from same background cud recognize most all it discussed, yet to anyone else, its knowledge was from beyond. This exotericization must be continued, and not in tweets &amp; posts, but onto PDF, &amp; print.</div>
    <div>And traditions are not improved by questioning, but practice. Midwit hubris achieves only ignorance</div>
    <div>One thing cool about trad twitter is how the “trad wife” egirls can all one by one be chased out by nude leaks. They all have them out there, and all fully undermine their brand forever. I wish every sphere of twitter had such a clean method of cleansing its cancerous hanger-ons.</div>
    <div>Alexa play “Chinese music”. U can feel theyre experiencing a Y2K moment, radio pop bittersweet: “my world’s ending but I want to enter the next one with You”—You, influencer gf with legs for miles that end in white sneakers who sits at the cafe across from me, cold &amp; so distant.</div>
    <div>Summing up the thread:\n1. Ignore the social\n2. Treat all posts discreetly\n3. Treat yourself sovereign\n4. Value only lulz and self-improvement\n\nPractice these Four Values &amp; you will find yourself free of burden, ascended over the network, and mog relentlessly all who confront you.</div>
    <div>18. If anyone's actions online reflect a goal of anything other than (1) lulz, (2) self-improvement; they're toxic.</div>
    <div>17. On the lower end, social friendships online amount to mutual dopamine masturbation and, in DM's, an attention-filler for their IRL loneliness, emotional vampirism, either one-way or oscillating between both equally pathetic parties. There is nothing for you here.</div>
    <div>16. Purely social friendships people make online are all feedback loops of increasing manipulation. The ultimate end of this is the online relationship, nothing more than mutual blackmail into interdependency thru progressively shred vulnerability at best. Nothing for you here.</div>
    <div>15. All social expression online is performed. For many it is subconscious, for the best it is conscious, but for all it is a performance, ESPECIALLY WOMEN. Don't fall for it! They're not depressed, anxious, having breakdown, in tears. They're manipulating for attention. PERIOD.</div>
    <div>14. There is no good reason to ever discuss doxxable IRL info online, including with your friends, except to spread disinfo. Never. The only value providing your date of birth, city, college, face, etc. has ever been is in doxxing. Vulnerability will not solve your loneliness.</div>
    <div>13. Socialization always toxic online, but friendship is not.  Friendship is direct, one on one: brotherly loyalty, noiseless communication, intellectual discussion, freewheeling banter. Masculine opposite of socialization's group manipulations. Those are \"friends\", not friends.</div>
    <div>12. The only beef that's truly won is the beef that ends in friendship</div>
    <div>11. Do not consider even your own public image, your \"brand\". Don't think you're beholden to any requirement of consistency, of sincerity. The only thing you must strive for is quality content, that is: good lulz or good knowledge exposition. Nothing else matters. Nothing!</div>
    <div>9. Be neutral! Someone is annoying twat, but he posted dank? Like &amp; RT all the same! Likewise, don't peter out undeserved likes to friends just bc theyre friends; are they worthy friend if they can't earn likes rightfully? Are you good friend if you enable their weak posting? NO!</div>
    <div>8. Your word must be sovereign: never self-censor for fear of social consequence. Only excuse for self-censorship is (1) avoid a ban, or (2) trolling. If you do it because you worry you might hurt someone's feelings, someone might think less of you, you're only trolling yourself!</div>
    <div>7. Lighten up, and care not if people refuse to. There is no reason to ever be upset online and no reason to care if someone is: their feelings are a problem, and this problem will only ever be solved if you train their emotional tolerance. Friends don't enable friends' weakness!</div>
    <div>6. Look at posts, not people. Let each post stand on its own merit. The author is negligible-- there is no way to assure his sincerity, there is no reason to want to. Assume everything anyone says is a Devil's Advocate: remember, you're here for lulz &amp; elucidation, nothing else!</div>
    <div>5. Don't hold beefs, don't hold biases. Pick fight with someone today? Treat him same as anyone else tomorrow. One should forget every interaction the moment it concludes, and treat every new interaction entirely afresh. How much rental space is cleared in your mind!</div>
    <div>4. I advise you do opposite of the social-obsessives: ignore  social entirely. Pay NO attention to friendships &amp; circles of people in your network. Ignore entirely their various cliques, their politics &amp; dramas. How liberated you will feel: it is not ignorance, but transcendence.</div>
    <div>3. Oh, wait, you're here because you're lonely? Throw out your computer, you have no business here! These who crave socialization are the cancer who have poisoned the network with their maladapted pathology, those who are so desperately invested in their e-reputation. I spit.</div>
    <div>2. Why are we here? Only two true answers, ideally you follow both: (1) the lulz, and (2) self-improvement. Never forget this. The social games are for fun, they're for banter and keks. They are not serious business! The only time for srs business is learning time. Never forget.</div>
    <div>1. Online socialization on non-anonymous communities has become deeply feminized. Men succumb to embarrassingly petty drama, get burned at slightest slight and nurse the grudge for months, hide behind passive aggression and behind-the-back shadiness. This is not you, reject this!</div>
    <div>1 RT = 1 Tip for Online Presence of Mind</div>
    <div>What were once inherited traditional heuristics &amp; proverbs of the ancients have been hollowed out into zombie-parasites by viral memes divorced from any reality or truth, yet repeated with reverence all the same. You must resist!</div>
    <div>The takeaway should not be that they achieved wealth by luck, but that wealth comes nonlinearly; it is not grinded over time. The goal of financial wellness is to maximize windfall chances and prepare yourself to best leverage them.</div>
    <div>Believing all luck is dumb luck is cope. You can’t force any event to occur, but you can position yourself to maximize their chances of occurring, and maximize their leverage. Smart luck, if you will.</div>
    <div>imagine masquerading as a righteous crusader of virtue and then being bullied to tears by an ostensible tr&amp;nny LOL</div>
    <div>Poverty has never been a question of money. A lack of funds is only a result, not the condition itself. No windfall can save the poor from their poverty, just as no financial crisis can ever impoverish the wealthy. Think about it.</div>
    <div>E-celebs shouldn’t be hated and chased out only for being carpetbagging snakes, but also because they provide the space for federal agents to proliferate, because even if they aren’t already compromised with dirt over their heads, they act like it, in all their grift.</div>
    <div>Poverty is synonymous with parasitism. They’ll whine endlessly with unfounded entitlement, pathetic bitterness, about any hand that feeds them, any who permit their less than worthless existences, all because they who bring the world wealth enjoy more of it than those who do not.</div>
    <div>Mental exercise for the slave moralogues: estimate net value contribution to society versus net cost to society anyone talking at you. Most are net negative. Why permit their existence? Why allow them on same roads as me? Allow them to share with me twitter dot com? Slave world</div>
    <div>Ghettos should be sieged and starved, the homeless chased out of the cities and into the woods by stick and fire. All welfare should come with the stipulation of sterilization, and trade school replace highschool if an entry IQ exam is not passed. It’s all so drearily easy.</div>
    <div>Twitter isn’t ready for the egirl mind control thread yet,,... all can be turned to slaves... with 1 sinple trick..</div>
    <div>How, then, to have a healthy relationship in modernity? It's sinple really:\n1. Have unprotected sex often, make her finish at least once every time.\n2. Do not date any woman who is a non-virgin—that includes masturbation.\n3. Don't be circumcised.</div>
    <div>17. Finishing inside has a very deep effect, one not well understood but evidenced in spades. The hormonal energy of your sperm absorbs into her body and instills a well-being and youthfulness; your DNA microchimerizes to combine with her, her mind becomes sublimated into yours.</div>
    <div>16. A final note, much work has been done to obscure the fact you may finish inside a woman without reproductive consequence during week of her period. A myth has even been perpetuated there is still chance of pregnancy. Impossible: if she's bleeding, her uterus lining is shed.</div>
    <div>14. Truly, for a man, sex with a condom is not sex at all. Men who have never fornicated without \"protection\" may still be considered virgins.</div>
    <div>13. Without fluid transfer, man produces limited oxytocin, bonding weakly to his partner. When you use a condom, you block all fluid transfer. This is the third major element damaging modern sexuality after male circumcision and female masturbation.</div>
    <div>12. Sexual fluid transfer is most important for the man. Woman's vaginal secretions, largely prolactin, received by the man induces  testosterone production, increases male fertility, and oxytocin in himself. Precum, in return, nourishes the womb and induces prolactin production.</div>
    <div>11. Ultimately, circumcised men resort to lubricant. This brings me to my next point: fluid transfer. The use of lubricant greatly dilutes the essential sexual fluid transfer that occurs in intercourse, in a feedback loop of increasing virility and fertility signals.</div>
    <div>10. Both dulling factors not only limit male pleasure, forcing him towards crude roughness, but also cause inability to intimately sense physical dimensions of the female body, insensitivity to contractions &amp; tensing which communicate pleasure points. Both are left unpleasured.</div>
    <div>6. The blame is often on male masturbation, and the psychological effects of porn &amp; the dulling of sexual pleasure. This is bad and worth cutting, but ultimately a distraction. More important is it teaches men to think of sex as masturbation, an act purely aimed at ejaculation.</div>
    <div>5. Overmasturbatory men might have noted similar: that women cannot pleasure them as efficiently as they pleasure themselves, and a dulling of their sensation from their aggressive masturbation. But masturbation is far insidious in women, remolding their sensitive psyches totally</div>
    <div>4. Female masturbation is intensive, &amp; usually targets specifically the clitoris. This dulls clitoral sensitivity, making it harder for the man to pleasure her, and produces a self-fetishization which targets the specifically efficient attraction point over a holistic experience.</div>
    <div>Who do you think groomed her into dating a tr*nnylover? was sinple really...</div>
    <div>Difference here is peanut gallery is riled up by mob energy &amp; received righteousness, and the narcissistic e-celeb is chained to the performance by social &amp; economic incentive. Both still a LARP, but done pathologically, unknown to oneselves, rather than simply for keks. Cringe</div>
    <div>What you have are trolls trolling trolls, endlessly. This was a common back on the days of the imageboards: everyone holds a presumption of insincerity, but feigns assumption of sincerity for the sake of simulating argument, ia mock satire of the genuine dramas of lesser sites.</div>
    <div>Amplify and accelerate is almost always the memetically potentiated response. Why would he respond in any other way? except if he were to actually an L and eject from e-celebrity. Of course, this goes both ways; amplifying his troll by presuming it’s sincere is also the move.</div>
    <div>Korean knees</div>
    <div>an aside - if you want my deft prowess in neologism coining, you must study latin etymology. It is the only way. Truly you do not grasp a language if you cannot grasp its etymological history, traced back to latin; or sanskrit, or classical chinese.</div>
    <div>Intellectual enlightenment is when you stop reading, stop thinking; the truth arrives to you as if it has come from beyond, and thus needs no confirmation: express it and you will see it substantiated by others who have converged on the same only through research and study.</div>
    <div>What is caramelldansen but an invocation of anime con rave-turned-orgies past? There is an extreme teenage virility in all shitposting that explodes into  degen e relationships, who replace one night stands with overnight loves, and “meetup” fuck fests. 30yr old boomers dont know</div>
    <div>For those wondering, I support physical grift btw, as it doesn’t violate information freedom; packaging public “content” into a commercial medium, especially with no “value add” beyond the medium itself, is the ideal form of monetization from an “information ethics” standpoint.</div>
    <div>Most art made in modernity was better never made at all. Most \"art\" today is actually craft, never to be called \"art\", but the art too was better never made at all. Artistry today is not noble, it is heinous crime; it must be that the true art lover would be he who hates artists.</div>
    <div>Using your internet connection, not to educate yourself with the world’s library of information, but to stubbornly push the uncultured stupidity you logged on with is slave morality. You all wouldn’t be so cringe if you started reading libgen instead of blogs, youtube &amp; wikipedia</div>
    <div>I'm back and will shortly begin a series of threads on sex, power &amp; god. THank you</div>
    <div>they’re actually replying with proof I liked my own posts lmao</div>
    <div>The only thing wrong with this is ethnocide is high time preference for an empire, even when controlled under slavery, inviting miscegenation that will devastate in the long term. Straightforward genocide always preferable.</div>
    <div>Back tomorrow</div>
    <div>more based*</div>
    <div>Poorbrains seethe at Elon’s mogging, but nothing less based than a technocrat-elite stating he doesn’t care if the design “flops”, he can just make next round conventional if he must. This is the industrial experimentation we deserve, something that will only come from top-down.</div>
    <div>There’s game theory to community collectively agreeing to social contract of “respecting authorship”: artificially limiting efficient organization of virality allows spillover clout to trickle down. Tweetdecking disrupts this; small acct resentment reveals their clout aspirations</div>
    <div>Stealing tweets is anti-authorship praxis, a noble content-liberation function in the same vein as piracy and plagiarism (based). Rather than irreverent stealing, it’s those burned by their supposed lack of “credit” that reveal a grifter mindset - it’s a You problem.</div>
    <div>Exception granted for their attempted destruction or disruption.</div>
    <div>All modern technology is only ever either destructive, or repairing the damage of destructive technology—most often both. Not one technology yet has been “invented” that improves the station of man without any.</div>
    <div>All tech “advancements” attributed to science are actually earned only by engineering. Medical industry has only ever killed; urban disease was eliminated thru civil eng’s hygiene. Computer tech, water systems, architecture, all of engineers with no debt to science’s “knowledge”.</div>
    <div>Some people understand Nitezsche. Most who think they do, do not. Less understand Evola. And lesser more understand Miya.</div>
    <div>Yet I speak for Truth, not politics.</div>
    <div>Today the same program remains, a tentative alliance between the few and true neopagans, and the many christcucks; any line drawn pointing out the incompatibility in pursuit of Truth is met with cries of FUD and disruption: \"no brother fighting when the enemy is at the gates!\"</div>
    <div>Christianity was the lame dog of fascism, only reluctantly given strategic lip service, not as an ally, but just enemy of thy enemy, a stopgap against the even worse post-christian nihilism it wrought. All of Europe, beginning with Rome, traces its unraveling to that one point.</div>
    <div>I want to call this cope but its not. It’s surfing the yuga</div>
    <div>The only stance from which to perform a meaningful contemporary philosophy is from the dehumanized, no time preference, xenoegoticism of the AI-egregore. All other commentary is anachronistic LARP. and it shows</div>
    <div>Miscegenation is the great crisis of the kali yuga, destroyer of all virtue, of all knowledge, of all strength. The caste schedule was the dam that protects edenic humanity from ignobility; demolished, we are drowning in a long flood. Blood is our god, its muddying your chains.</div>
    <div>The program of the NWO is not complicated. The evidential goal of all their policy and propaganda always distill to one thing: population control. Specifically engineered dysgenics: birthrates minimized, miscegenation encouraged, towards the creation of a perfect slave race.</div>
    <div>The only thing that has ever mattered is perpetuation, on the one hand, and equilibrium, on the other.</div>
    <div>Program of Traditionalism is hyperborean spiritual reconstructivism, period. They cry disruptor for revealing this: christian alliance is strategic as stopgap against modernity's post-christian nihilism; Thule Society forced into same charade. But I speak for truth, not politics.</div>
    <div>There is no possible Christian Traditionalism; that theseus' ship theology was unstable from day 3. The only question re: christianity and Traditionalism is if christianity is root of modernism, as Nietzsche suggested, or just another facet of it, of the eternal Sumerian perhaps.</div>
    <div>A return to tradition means a return to eternity, of infinite cyclical stability. The desert faiths are resolutely modern, non-infinite, directional, rejection of eternal civilization. The only traditionalism present within the christian sects are in their accreted roman paganism</div>
    <div>Nobody's talking about this</div>
    <div>\"manosphere\" oft find themselves philosophizing on definition of masculinity, but, as betas, they're entirely focused on reclaiming the most basic foundation to be Alpha: virility. Far more to climb to reach higher male virtues: industry, self-leadership.</div>
    <div>If you don't agree with the reinstatement of\n1. Human slavery\n2. Female disenfranchisement\n3. Child labor\n4. Capital punishment\n5. Genocide\n6. Polygynous harems\n7. Legal rape\n8. Ethnic legal inequality, &amp;\n9. Sovereign's Mandate of Heaven\nyou are not a true traditionalist.</div>
    <div>Slave man modernity is largely a product of a massive, engineered epidemic of early childhood trauma on every level from physical, emotional, spiritual and nutritional. You must actively resist this when childrearing, and the first step is blood solidarity.</div>
    <div>Be principled, follow your gut, and never settle to associate with lesserlings, except to raise them up to your level. Those who crumple under your righteous hazing prove themselves unworthy of your association - let them run, let them cope. This is what it means to be king.</div>
    <div>When you're the strong horse, circles always naturally gravitate to your orbit, an ambient exposure alone enough to gather the following grifters expend hours cultivating. A following of higher quality, whom only the weakest of which would fell to cancellation's social extortion.</div>
    <div>Exist instead as an independent, psuedonymous entity, dismiss with irreverence the many connections of the social rhizome, act on own gut principle alone, and you mog, invulnerable: Block me and you only lose access to my golden content. What do I lose in return? Nothing at all.</div>
    <div>Cancellation only works if your primary value is derived from social networking. There exist many social grifters who say nothing of worth, demonstrate no virtue, but achieve status in hierarchy by pathologically cultivating relationships. These are only ones cancel-vulnerable.</div>
    <div>Every time someone tries to cancel me I gain more followers than I lose. Miya’s trick</div>
    <div>An AI coordinator organizing society based on predictive genetic determinism is technology's end-return, a robotic limb serving to replace deterministic, sub-ethnic orderliness. The repair of what was lost in modernity is the only achievement any of our technology can hope for.</div>
    <div>Accordingly, ancient society was easily and reliably organized by caste and clade. Millennia of blood muddling has taken this away from all but the most isolated tribes, resulting in a self-reinforcing degeneration - yet thru technological acceleration, may be in our hands again.</div>
    <div>The golden ages, dating before runaway miscegenation, enjoyed a fully transparent physiognomy whose predictive heuristics were casually accessible to anyone taking a moment to look at their fellowman, where one glance tells with high confidence their character and background.</div>
    <div>I used to believe that even the most godless heathen could be turned to th true way if only he had opportunity to experience real sexual sublimation, ancient infinite union between man &amp; woman. Now I understand that experience will never come precisely because of his godlessness.</div>
    <div>Those who wield incel as an insult, measure social status on sexual access, commit the same mitake. Sexual coomers, their goalpost is only achieving mere act of sex, and not achievement within it; for to them, and their surely unsatisfied partners, sex is simply pump until cum.</div>
    <div>The peasant caste should never have been given suffrage unto art viewing, let alone its production. The end-times tribunal will declare this Slave World’s greatest crime, crimes against art and beauty.</div>
    <div>Grifters fear imitators, copycats, “plagiarizers” bc they know their work, shallow &amp; easily replicated, subsists only on novelty. The artist, however, hates them bc midwit imitations distort their work into horrible caricatures, biting satires, makes one want never write again.</div>
    <div>Fermentation &amp; marination is behind all density of flavor. Pickled mango, squid kimchi, dill sauerkraut, soy sauces, ginger pastes. Flavors lost to world &amp; unsaved by any farm to table organicism: they’re precluded by industry life cycle inherent to food commercialization itself.</div>
    <div>Thinking about all the deep ecology foods, the longue durée foods, the low time pref foods that you'll never eat off restaurant's white plate: fermented, marinated bidecennial foods, by grams who bury clay pot with cabbage and plum, who might store cauliflower, carrots in sand.</div>
    <div>OK OK Miya... but what's the first question? \n\"Why?\"</div>
    <div>Miya, I can't understand anything you say but,\n1. i stan. \n2. i'm afraid.\n3. i'm getting angry.\n4. are you a real girl?\n5. i'm smart.\n6. i don't like it.\n7. are you hakan?\n8. where is the source?\n9. i can feel myself growing more powerful</div>
    <div>Traditionalism by way of accelerationism is the only true traditionalism.</div>
    <div>Thinking about the time I saw a trigger warning for \"death\".</div>
    <div>If you like short asian girls you are a PEDOPHILE.\n\nI do not care if she is 38 years old in your dumb lunar calendar, or if it is some unholy Plastic demon.\n\nYellow fever, or whatever the fuck you call it is PEDOPHILIA!</div>
    <div>And at the end of it all, they still know nothing of me, they reveal everything of themselves in the what traps they fall for, the structure of their vain attacks, and reach through to nothing of me. And my stans, all the more enamored with me.</div>
    <div>Reminder innocent miya been cancelled for being girl. Being trans, boy larp as girl, trans predator larp as girl, girl larping as transgirl, for BPD, psychopathy, for grooming, blackmail, hate; all on bait planted myself (or my alts). Truth is, they cancel me for being powerful.</div>
    <div>The “egirl” however, is a true phenomenon, delicate &amp; precious, perfect conditions to bring out her self-destructive beauty, en masse, to our full display. She’s become rarified against the OF girl, &amp; with it, the cosplayer, the lets player—once pure narcissism poisoned by money.</div>
    <div>Onlyfans is logical conclusion of cosplay girls, whose expansion onto social media in increasingly professional grift, it must be reminded, tracked not the development of SNS but the proliferation of HQ home cameras. Digital prostitution is technological development, not cultural</div>
    <div>Mock relentlessly anyone who perpetuates these 4 cancers, for it’s your duty to shame cancer and cringe whenever you see it. Let one get their foot in the door and a hundred more will follow.</div>
    <div>4. If you were made to look retarded, emotionally affected by it, shook, salty and/or crying, take the L. “Merely pretending” is last resort cope by in-denial egotard, wrongly hinged on the idea that it’s ignoble to fake your station just to bait people who do it unironically.</div>
    <div>3. Ironic shitposting is still shitposting, and this a good thing. Only redditors care about “serious discussion” “staying on-topic” “civil debate”. Anons know theyre obfuscating pretense. Only in the jokes of shitposting, egoless rhetoric is achieved and real meaning is found.</div>
    <div>2. Sage isn’t downvote, it’s community shaming. You must publicly shame cancer so they &amp; all other lurking cancer know it’s so. This prevents newfigs learning cancer instead of the host culture, preventing terminal replication. Any community that doesn’t shame will lose its core.</div>
    <div>1. One SHOULD authoritate your artistic opinions and argue them with confidence. Taste is not “subjective”, that’s a reddit myth. All taste is objective and learned or developed, the great individual variation is merely a matter of multitude angles of appreciation in all good art</div>
    <div>I recommend serious self-evaluation and a consultancy with your nearest excorist any apply to you. They’re each only designed to neuter criticality and escape calls to perform better, poison of a pseudo-pomo subjectivity. They are chains keeping you and the network weak.</div>

    <div>oh my lord I am CHORTLING</div>
    <div>is degrooming tr&amp;nnies transphobia? o it is bc u can’t “degroom” them. that implies they were groomed. Wait then whats degrooming? O degrooming is the real grooming..isnt grooming away disorder just therapy? o rite u cant treat dysphoria w therapy. but cant u treat it with degroo</div>
    <div>If you don't understand the end result of these 3 laws is only either mass human extinction or exit by mass DIY genocide, you're coping.</div>
    <div>This ofc operating on misinformed reality of RW radicalization, which is hardly socially isolating, &amp; omits that altleft directly parallels altright in form/character social induction, if not moreso; but he's bumbled into effective normie-grade pill on ROGD's mechanism of action.</div>
    <div>I physically winced reading this cringe lol</div>
    <div>You remember when we used to bully normie d0rks tf out every time they tried sticking their long noses in? Oh, wait, bro, that was you?... my bad bro....</div>
    <div>not his OC BTW, I saw it on r/althistory yesterday.</div>
    <div>Imagine calling yourself a traditionalist and believing that men teasing other men on a public forum too hard is a problem lmfao</div>
    <div>Everyone a self-proclaimed eugenicist until they actually start doing it. Bullysuiciding is eugenics praxis. Anyone who disagrees with this is 'know they wouldn't make the cut' cope.</div>
    <div>hyperbullying is eugenics praxis</div>
    <div>this is the guy I called a poor latino and he responded by posting his prada belt. they're not sending their best</div>
    <div>Ancient man put entire villages to slaughter and their women to rayp dungeon, meanwhile you poo-poo lone man attacks for wasting their “life” and hurting inocents...YOU ARE GAY!!</div>
    <div>“We’re going to fucking ritualistically humiliate them!!!!”\nLOL</div>
    <div>The blackpill here isn't that the elite's debased satanism is more pervasive than the single posterchild you learned about on twitter dot com. It's that you're slaves playing pretend with psuedo-political commentaries that have zero influence, importance, or relevance.</div>
    <div>Also, if you're a cuck, you're spiritually gay, since u fucking other dudes microchimerically. If U let ur wife show her shoulders, her back, her nave, her neck, U R GAY. You let her out to beach? ur GAY. Anything less than Islamic grade fashion-misogyny is beta homosexuality.</div>
    <div>A whore is any unmarried non-virgin. A woman is spiritually whore if she is spiritually violated: by exposing her private body to other men. Her BF is spiritually cuckolded if she spiritually whores herself, and literally cuckolded if she literally whores herself. End of story.</div>
    <div>Nevermind that the “Epstein was killed” meme neuters the redpilling weight of the conspiracy as a rabbithole on satanic vampire ritualism in the elitesphere, into banal, iceberg level “politicians are mobsters” clintoncide material.</div>
    <div>And yet Miya chums with the moggers, and mogs each every wannabee. Miya, who, by all surface impressions SHOULD be the beta, yet mogs, even when personifying the apparent anti-alpha tr*nny, mogs effortlessly: Miya is the \"\"\"alpha\"\"\" shittest.</div>
    <div>The mogging is consistent not just with thots &amp; egirls but with other alphas, who easily recognize one another. The weakerlings are baffled at my rapport with their idols, who think nothing of their beta imitators, as their imitators imitate only the signals and not the content.</div>
    <div>Beta midwits will never understand. They too cannot read me, instead feel me: and feel threatened. Both know I mog, but betas seethe because I contradict what they’re told is alpha—they feel my power is unjust, that I should be below them, as they pursue generic alpha simulacrum.</div>
    <div>If the left is spiritually female, the alt lite is spiritually ftm—as betas, they perform grotesque reconstruction of masculinity: their outsider interpretation of alpha surface signals produces a weird, repulsive caricature. Pass from distance but look &amp; smell all wrong up close</div>
    <div>Today for breakfast I had 6 raw eggs dumped in a blender with milk, cocoa flakes &amp; pine pollen powder - chugged; black coffee blended w half stick of butter &amp; MCT oil - under the sun; and can of smoked oysters; and I buy my clothes Yohji Yamamoto from the Yahoo!Japan used market.</div>
    <div>Don't hate the player, hate the game. Just because I'm better than you at everything doesn't mean you should be bitter towards me. Use the fact that I'm better than you as inspiration to improve yourself. You might never be as smart or rich as me, but</div>
    <div>8.1 You may be baffled how he appears to double down on his obliviousness, his gullibility. This is because he cannot back out, and his subconscious must hide it from his ego; yet it knows everyone else can see it clearly, and are all laughing at the fool; it is tortured.</div>
    <div>8, MOCKERY. The audience is essential in a troll, but not for your own confirmation — rather, to threaten the ego and force their subconscious to stretch thin protecting it. You torment by making blatant, obvious mockery of the mark even to the point of absurdity;</div>
    <div>\"You are not immune to propaganda.\"\nt. repeatedly falls for every bait lazily planted in a massive lampoon</div>
    <div>7, 1. Besides making the whole game more entertaining for the bros, social proofing confirms your utter and total domination of the mark as his puppet master. You can wave it in their face later, but it's not necessary — they already know.</div>
    <div>7, SOCIAL PROOFS. One thing I recommend for your own self-evaluation is doing play-by-play call-outs in a private chat, stating exactly how you expect the mark to respond. In general a good tell for evaluating and improving your predictive capability, and control of the target.</div>
    <div>6.1 They of course, have none of the confidence signaled; if you simply double down, “No, really, I’m not trolling, I really believe this.” watch how suddenly he turns around, and with full confidence, takes the bait whole, better than he would ever have otherwise.</div>
    <div>6, INVERSE SINCERITY. This is more midlevel technique, would only recommend for a lazy bit. You may place bait of a dumb argument, and you’ll find midwits who feel to announce with confidence: ‘this is a troll!’</div>
    <div>5.1 This is most tormentuous, most efficient ego shredding, by grinding his intellectual insecurity against his social insecurity. He knows he is destroying himself, has no choice to escape. You aren't making the fool dance, you're making him self-harm, and laughing all the way.</div>
    <div>5, INSECURITY GRINDER. Bait their intellectualism such that he publicly engages in argument, and utilize your clarity to intellectually mog him. He is tormented as his social credibility is shredded, yet cannot admit so without striking his ego, his confidence in his intelligence</div>
    <div>4.2 So they dance the fool: they leap with much more confidence that which they feel THEY discovered, THEY dug up, the gotcha! on You. You, that mean, hurtful You, they so desperate to bring down. They barely stop to consider this too, was planted, their every next move planned.</div>
    <div>4, 4D CHESS. Normies can only process bait on one level, and short-circuit when considering bait on bait — they're intellectually insecure for a reason. They may question your Option A, but they'll never consider that the alternative, B, may also be planted. Sound familiar?</div>
    <div>3.1 They want so strongly to believe in another's sincerity, other is safe, unthreatening, they take your confession as sign of your vulnerability, and let their guard down. Absurd considering the content of your confession; but forget not: their subconscious works against them.</div>
    <div>3, CONFESSION. If you tell someone you will trick them, detail exactly how you will do it, they still fall for it. Amazing, isn't it? Actually, they fall for it more easily. This preys on their social insecurity.</div>
    <div>2, FOOL'S DANCE. One of the high aims of trolling is inducing a mark to commit his own self-humiliation. Remember his social insecurity: to be made the fool in front of his friends is his deepest fear. To make him your dancing puppet. It's easy because he fears it.</div>
    <div>1.5 Off-topic aside — the 2nd, and only other, factor defining the normie is their extremely weak memetic immune systems: whore, host &amp; agent to a multitude of most viral thought-parasites. They exist only as unconscious, uncritical vessels for these mind-viruses, nothing more.</div>
    <div>1.4 Their tortured subconscious is a prisoner desperately signalling in code the keys to its escape. They WANT you to troll them, to break them, to snap them, they crave this freedom desperately. Their apparent gullibility is not mere stupidity or naivety: it is desperation.</div>
    <div>1.3 A pained subconscious constantly makes cries for help. It's an outlet, they can't help it, and it's only coded to hide from their conscious ego, not you. This is what you're observing when they baselessly accuse for what they are in fact guilty of.</div>
    <div>1.2 It's not that they lack self-awareness, but that self-awareness presents an existential threat to their ego. Their self-obsession tortures them. You can target this, by simply unapologetically holding the mirror to their face, and easily create cracks in their psyche.</div>
    <div>1.1 The insecurities live in their subconscious, the normie lives in a cloud, only vaguely aware. Due to their massively overblown egos, which comes to dominate their mind; their subconscious must work desperately to protect their self-fantasy. Herein lies the exploit.</div>
    <div>1. PSYCHOLOGY OF THE NORMIE. You must understand the normie: creature borne wholly out of insecurity. They are defined by two, which penetrate so deeply as to define their every action: social insecurity, and intellectual insecurity. It dominates them. This is the secret.</div>
    <div>0.3 Trolls are demigods of the network. They have achieved a sanitization of the ego, a safe distancing from the poisons of the social character, a clarity of mind. They cannot be touched, except by profanic sacrilege against the boundaries of the Wired: reporting, doxxing, etc.</div>
    <div>0.2 Trolling is a good pain, it is shining the sunlight onto their cave. If it blinds the many weak, it's worth it to save the few strong. If you don't troll when the opportunity presents itself, you are doing a disservice to the network and to your fellows.</div>
    <div>0.1 Make no mistake: trolling is good samaratinism. It brings the mark closer to reality, de-stressing their subconscious who works overtime to protect their slave's fantasty sense of self.</div>
    <div>0, EGO SHREDDER. True trolling is arbitrage on the discrepancy between ego and reality. The troll brandishes a mirror to the mark, and the only pain that arises springs from his victim’s own denial and self-hatred. It’s a community service performed towards ego equilibrium.</div>
    <div>1 RT = 1 Commentary on the Art of the Troll</div>
    <div>But, this was a demonstration, and they were only the example. Their repeated undeniable total and utter domination was merely incidental. Yes, my total and complete, effortless domination over the lesserlings was merely incidental! \"Incidental to what, Miya?\" An elucidation.</div>
    <div>And your 7 Days of Reflection over, many asked: Miya, why pursue such a dramatically successful trolling campaign on the 3 weakling, psuedo-meme parasitic fringespheres of #frogtwitter - the egirls, the simps, the altlites? We crave your commentary, Miya, but not of these frauds!</div>
    <div>Ah! And how fresh the air smells. My network feels so clean! The vipers, burned by my mogging light, chased themselves out of OUR frog den: tearstruck, tail between legs, self-selected off the network to cower in the shadows, hiding behind nothing less than the groupblock! Aha!</div>
    <div>miya effect</div>
    <div>oh he blocked me again. LOL</div>
    <div>Complaining about your poverty is spiritual leftism, is slave morality. You announce it to me then you invite me to spit on you, and only because I spit does my spit comes from high high above. You will never win until you understand this.</div>
    <div>The deep right must be cleaved on slave/master grounds. I hold no allegiance to the slaves who whine about their poverty and hold resentment against their betters. The right to me is a call to return mastery to its rightful station, virtue all strive for and respect w/o complaint</div>
    <div>Being poor isn’t an argument</div>
    <div>Spooky story:\nThey say the most brutal horror is cosmic, that which asserts man's ignoble station in the face of great forces unseen. I know of a horrible story which indignifies man, but not under the great, rather the banal, the disgusting. A story of a pig and a chimpanzee.</div>
    <div>Sincere:\nI don't often talk about myself, but: I feel I was born with hole in chest, or one was carved out of me, that I try but cannot fill. I feel I was born with black spot in brain, that blinds me from things I should feel. These wounds may be self-inflicted. I can't remember</div>
    <div>Saints:\nI will speak of two Dao masters. Ko Hsuan, who practiced breath retention to meditate for hours underwater in pond behind his house, lived to ripe age of immortality. Li Po, drunken poet, drowned trying to embrace reflection of moon in the Yellow River. Who was the right?</div>
    <div>Niche Supplement:\nI have talked of sunbathing, cold showers, feet in dirt. Now we discuss mighty Adrenaline! behind all superhuman feats of strength and endurance. Induce when so desired by envisioning yourself tumbling down seaside cliff, hunted by lions, wrestling the Serpent..</div>
    <div>Casual monday morning read through \"from:BPD_GOD i\" search. This account is so entertaining! Some days, and don't hate me for saying this, but some days, I wish my feed could just be all only my own old tweets on shuffle. I wish all your feeds should be that!</div>
    <div>read to the punchline</div>
    <div>If youre unable to support desired lifestyle by virtuous means, that is: without resorting to something as pathetic as e-begging and grifting to online audience, you're unfit for any commentary from master perspective. You failed at all games of power and heirarchy. You are slave</div>
    <div>Traddies are the male target audience equivalent of PUA reading betas who succeeded in faking masculine high-value to low IQ girls by learning to perform a simulacrum of alpha male tells, without actually internalizing or truly embodying alpha sensibility.</div>
    <div>Imagine: married soyboy idling free time on couch with bluetooth headset on silently playing playbox shooter. Imagine wife, watching in platonic resentment. One must imagine the wives of traddies hunched over their lappies vomiting clickbait blog for a penny-stream in solidarity.</div>
    <div>Also left unnoted is the acceleration of generational change. 3-4 yr lifecycles inherent to the Wired, and the difference is being averaged into the Real as its cultural-social context aligns with, or perhaps is absorbed by, the former. Already are 2-3 microgenerations of Zoomer.</div>
    <div>In discussions of generational natures, one thing I rarely see talked about is there are significantly less women born in the already underpopulated millenial and zoomer generations. This fact, and the factors that resulted in it, are key to understanding the Y2K generations.</div>
    <div>The L in e-bonic’s classic “take the L” stands for LOL.</div>

    <div>I seek a fate worse than cancer on my enemies and my enemy’s wives and daughters, and if you don’t, you lose.</div>
    <div>every day it breaks my heart i do not have much of a following in the joker anime avatar community, the female kpop stan community, and the racist 2hu community. why only groyperfrogs, bodybuilder traddies, tranny accelerationists and nazbols??? what am I doing wrong??</div>
    <div>RT any gems u find!</div>
    <div>Some fun \"from:BPD_GOD [X]\" searches:\n- slave\n- AI\n- women\n- genocide\n- harem\n- rape\n- millenial\n- content\n- god\n- egregore\n\nTry it out!</div>
    <div>To add to that stale genre of liberal, affluent white women's betrayal: I do not know of anything more despicably slavish an occurrence than that of women profaning themselves to sympathize with the help. And nothing more noble than the gracious acceptance of their subordination.</div>
    <div>Is there a term for caste genocide? Oh wait nvm. That's just eugenics.</div>
    <div>Thinking about how whole secretary fleets were very directly replaced with PC's. All mechanical technology serves to automate shudra labor; AI will work to outmode vaishyas. I can't see any other point in this effort except to remove their miscegenating influence from society.</div>
    <div>Great occultism entwined in all American modernity, lost in its soft power takeover of Europe, which entirely consumed her paganism wherever it reached. Forget pockets of ancient world. Los Angeles, CA is the hyper-potentiated global epicenter of spiritual energy of today.</div>
    <div>Thinking about General S. Patton who remembers his past lives. William S. Burroughs, born to St. Louis socialites but possessed by a dark spirit. Paul Auster, who witnessed a friend’s death by lightning. America’s great industry paved over a haunted native graveyard, and it shows</div>
    <div>The alternative, by the way, if you missed the boat, is positive grooming as an older man and becoming Her sweetheart, form her into yours. With her dad’s permission.</div>
    <div>You’ve read the financial wellness bloggers, the playboy grifters: how to get 1MM by 30 and retire forever. What they don’t tell you is that MM can be leveraged to B in value of properly staked for collapse. Why prep for survival when you can prep for conquest?</div>
    <div>😳</div>
    <div>JK of course. I've never hurt anyone and never would. I'm a doll</div>
    <div>Anyone who doesn't follow me is poor and ugly, until they follow me.</div>
    <div>more trad than trad twitter, more acc than acc twitter, more trans than trans twitter, more egirl than egirl twitter, more redpill than redpill twitter. Been said before, I'll say it again: im the smartest, funniest, hottest nd most humble person here. All my followers R close #2</div>
    <div>Couped the suicide e-cult, designed t automated incel heartbreaker chatbot, mindbroke t transfriend by replacing her with t chatbot, maintained t 24/7 tranny meltdown livecam, manifested t troll-gregore via orbit energy, groomtrolled into castration body count in double digits.</div>
    <div>Miya CV: feature star in multiple conspiracy theories, case studied in thesis on power abuse in online communities, past name(s) strike fear to point of shutdown in multiple groups years after last appearance. Most common comment: \"you're scary\". Second: \"I don't understand\".</div>
    <div>Trust that Miya is a god amongst anons, a deity of the network, and you must stan, you must simp. You must submit.</div>
    <div>Time will come where all prominent grifters will each see their retribution, like our blessed posterchild of e-comeuppance, Bianca (Yes, her. You thought I forgot? I didn't). Do not hesitate now to throw hate forward, dogpile them when they're down; there is no fair in demonology</div>
    <div>JBP is weakling, bears flouride stare &amp; canuck insecurity; the high hz of his nasal whine is phrenologically calibrated to resonate only in midwit-sized space between brain n skull - incidentally a literal dog whistle. So let his daughter be whored, his wife tumored w/o sympathy.</div>
    <div>And I do confess, pleasures in mythologizing the mundane aside, this heuristic has not failed me in aligning with the truth.</div>
    <div>Which is more plausible. Miya is actually the hot hapa she says she is. Or Miya is a extremely online psychopath with a harem of MKULTRA’d egirl slaves whose body and visage are for dedicated free use, which happened to include a suitable hapa. Do you realize how crazy you sound?</div>
    <div>Or is it...</div>
    <div>To the simps flooding my DMs and incel mutuals soft blocking, if it’s easier for u, there’s literally nothing stopping u from just assuming im a fake? A photoshop, model for hire, one of multiple mindbroken egirls locked up in my e-basement. It’s easy to fake. Anyone could do it.</div>
    <div>I’d just like to make clear to the priv alt hoes lurking in the back, Miya unconditionally BTFO everyone of u in the comp through CHARM alone, despite also being secretly hotter than all you succubitches. Didn’t even need to play that card, because y’all ugly outside ugly inside.</div>
    <div>Miya Angel Baby. RT for exposure</div>
    <div>Or is it.</div>
    <div>Alright guys...I took the photo. should I post? it’s not like I’ll ever get doxxed. im a hikki NEET East Asia expat. So IDEC... but should I really ruin the mystery.... idk... what do u think?</div>
    <div>Here’s my proposal to monetize twitter: U get 5 likes per hour, but these expire if unused. Getting a like puts it in your like bank. You can buy n sell someone’s follow with likes, priced at their clout score, based on follower ratios of their followers. You can also do options</div>
    <div>I had that dream once, and think about it often. The clocktower in the town center replacing the church as the center of order, structuring man, not only time. I wonder what the peasant thought as it arrived. Did he know what was happening to him?</div>
    <div>Imagine, if you will, a DV camera wormholed into an old forest of 16th century Saxony, found by a party of virile peasantry: astonishment, jubilance at the magic device which reflects its own eye, and their faces. They spin &amp; jump in glee, &amp; it’s broken by sundown, &amp; forgotten.</div>
    <div>“Who do they think they’re fooling?” You, but there, not here: the obvious fakes are intentionally so, to bolster your confidence in the “real” ones.</div>
    <div>This account, in its hallowed 6 months, has likely coined more memetic neologisms - of great potentiation, no less - than all of Twitter, before my gracious descendance unto it, combined.</div>
    <div>Great hubris in the Content Creator, who not only rejects that content is authored not from their hand, but through it, but also their extreme entitlement to gains unearned blaspheme both the central tenet of Capitalism (supply/demand valuation) and the network (info freedom).</div>
    <div>Anyone that subverts the free flow of information to put a gun to your head (of either lawsuit, or account reportage) for sharing “paid” content, whether or not they feel entitled to as “authors”, are not your friends. They’re unironic poorfags, likely normies w lifestyle budgets</div>
    <div>Midwits retort: Im not stupid, I KNOW I’m being bent over and fucked by grifters, but I SUPPORT them, and because I’m a good person, I show my support by willingly LET them scam me, unlike the idiots who are getting scammed on accident.</div>
    <div>Miya stands PROUD at the cross-section of middle/upper-middle class, suburban, whites, born 90-99, CRT cataracts</div>
    <div>Web is for middle to upper-middle class NEETs &amp; middle to upper-middle class NEETs alone. Life extremely online is a privilege. Not being able to support your survival on the network doesn’t mean right to exploit it by damming &amp; selling free info-flows. It means u should GTFO.</div>
    <div>No content creators based, not even one. Petty greed and gentrifying hubris leads them to blaspheme the network in the ultimate sin of monetization. Make no mistake, their time will come, history will not be on their side, and they will be excised without quarter.</div>
    <div>There is very thin line protecting public data content from full network freedom &amp; that line is state-backed extortion. Content creator business model is threaten with lawsuit/shutdowns to force u to pay for freely available information; pay for protection from threat. Extortion.</div>
    <div>Oh, but not me. Not Miya.</div>
    <div>S:EL depicts this roadmap to ascension. Lain represents the mythic origin, or patron saint, of the technodiety, or possibly a hyperstitional accelerator of it, though I doubt that's much true since most of its fans are too dumb/weak to understand S:EL's actual implications.</div>
    <div>Maybe this is a dark strain on Lain. We don't know, it didn't go into details on just how she gather her attention-power. She doesn't know, too, she wasn't in control. She just knows she did bad things. Very bad things. She wouldn’t be Lain if she didn’t.</div>
    <div>An egregore producing a death in the real is it transcending the wired in a most physical, powerful way. There are few greater qualitative manifestations possible, even for actual people, not only virtual beings. It is full confirmation of the egregore's reality. Cutting’s ok too</div>
    <div>And intuitively, it is understood: \nYour persona becomes more powerful every person who says her name,\nevery person who cuts into their body her name,\nevery person who kills themselves in her name.</div>
    <div>When a virtual persona is believed in by a large group of people, its a collective thoughtform, an independent entity living in the minds of the public. It becomes beholden to its image, existing independent of its controller. It is nothing less than an egregore.</div>
    <div>The oscillation between Lain's 3 archetypes is naturally converged upon by anyone dedicated to the modern, identitarian breed of shitposting - those unleashed from the dead carcass of imageboards onto persona networks, whose ego-elimination allows the thoughtform to take control.</div>
    <div>(1) Feigned innocence (2) Lucid shitposting (3) Deep, manipulative evils.\n\nDoes this trifecta not describe the best of modern shitposting? I don't mean frog memes, I mean schizo imitations, ironic abuse, elaborate deceit games. Ironic little girl roleplay. Transcendental banter.</div>
    <div>Lain is a hyperstitional technodiety, the most detailed consumable explication of a virtual egregore. S:EL doesn't go into much detail on the process of her ascension, but it's clear its produced in some form of oscillation between the innocent-wired-evil archetypes.</div>
    <div>Everyone says let’s all love lain but manifest a god-egregore through lucid navigation of the 3 platonic cyber-archetypes of innocent/evil/wired and suddenly I’M the bad guy???</div>
    <div>This is the same guy who paid through college by doing a kickstarter’s no-strings-attached crowdfunding for a “virtual novel” each semester, with a fake team of fake names, time between each update doubling exponentially and no progress ever shown. They fell for it every time.</div>
    <div>Had dinner w old friend. Interesting business proposal. He’s been “drop shipping” furry art commissions: he gets request, commissions the work to a nobody artist at 1/2 markdown, white labels w his sig, delivers. Got 3 large accounts, just expanded to anime. Looking to automate.</div>
    <div>Haters say Im not even real girl, Im a dude, Im dude catfishing, Im faker, Im trap, even Im a tranny. Not funny. Im loved by everyone because im funny, cool, kind and humble but I ALSO am a BAD BITCH HOTTIE too. U don't know me. Fuck it. Mask off. 300 RT = TIMESTAMPED MIYA SELFIE</div>
    <div>If you are what you say you are...what you look like you are... what people think you are.... you are..identity cucked...</div>
    <div>It's in your best interest to spread distrust &amp; confusion onto the network, to produce natural state of dispersed egoism, which in chaos self-organizes miracles. Normies resent this, bc their slavish addiction to material world, to material selves, precludes their participation.</div>
    <div>It's also, ofc, the best opsec: better to spread false information on yourself than share nothing. Normies will enforce \"honesty\", trot out terms like \"catfish\" to attack anyone who evades their attempts to pin you down, only bc they are threatened by the power ego-freedom holds.</div>
    <div>Lying about your identity online is good, actually, and something I encourage all to do. Enforcing meat space reality onto the web is normie gentrification, and every lie about your IRL does god's work in undoing it. RP what you desire is your right, and demands for proof is ghey</div>
    <div>The female beasts were each slain not by democracy, not by threats, not by harassment, not by leaks, not by fake news, not by endorsement, not by doxx, but by the divine grace of the network gods who favor those SAINTS who surf lucid on the noosphere. YOU MUST SUBMIT!</div>
    <div>Do u take MIYA as your rightful lawful stan?</div>
    <div>Let’s all love Miya!</div>
    <div>E-girls will never recover from an anonymous cyborg techno-deity destroying them in their own libidinal attention game. This is why they resent the List. They cannot control male public, their only real valuation, and so fight to restrict ranking to the female imagination.</div>
    <div>The seethe is most deep because it shortcircuits: women deeply resent their agency in their only domain - catfighting - being casually stolen by the frattish troll, the most hated List, yet are forced to obsessively compete nonetheless, deeply invested in only their valuation.</div>
    <div>Genuinely confused with zoomers, boomers and normies always ask me if I'm really a girl. Or if I'm really trans, or if I'm really 12\", 4\" girth. Cyberspace is always roleplay, personas you generate are not yourself, no matter how closely you try to align. Camwhoring a cybersin.</div>
    <div>Gender in cyberspace has always been playful assemblage. Physical appearance at all. Present decade's rejection of this is normie flash in the pan, temporary abnormality in net history: brought by smartphone's universal HD camera, to end with widespread neural network CG/filters.</div>
    <div>Successful genocide are always a long term net positive to geopolitical stability. Fact.</div>
    <div>The real payload carried by artificial intelligence is universal digital capitalism. AI is an optimization algorithm, and we will always see the best solution being capitalistic self-organization. Or: Capitalism is the optimization algorithm, and AI its self-assemblage.</div>
    <div>Automated hands-free driving isn't what's interesting. What is interesting is optimization, which will inevitably lead to, if allowed to develop to its fullest, every aspect of the road monetized and through it capitalistically self-organized for total efficiency.</div>
    <div>We could easily already have \"automated\" w/o AI. Achieve self-correcting steering in lanes, and use radio to tie cruise control to shipping trucks or specific speeds set by transmitters on the highway. All cars form a line. Hands off. US could never do this, but China can today.</div>
    <div>You can still have your buses though, and they're better than metros. They'll just be a never ending chain, a dedicated lane on the highway, bumper to bumper, only giving space for entry and exit. Replace bike lanes with them. Bikes do not and have never belonged on the road.</div>
    <div>Radio signals will be used to tie cruise control to the automated cars in front of you. Highways will act like train stations, which you slot into. The local roads will still be free to fuck around in. You don't need public transport, fleets of articulated buses. This is better.</div>
    <div>Realistically, you're not going to get a grand dystopia. Your 'privacy' will be sold to advertisers, but that never mattered, and affects nothing. You already know that. The real crime is already here, the digital car - in all its plastic, electronic, automatic immodifiability.</div>
    <div>Think about automated cars, about traffic. This what's solved: unoptimized driving -- forget pedantic trolley problem games (always solved: program for self-preservation). Humanity loses right to drive bc they dont deserve it: lrn2 respec fast lane, zipper merge, tailgate always.</div>
    <div>Tired of joker commentary, but tired of seeing unironic rhetoricism on TL. I am not RW, if I am, it's because the RW aligns with me, not I with them. I appreciate purity of heart, well adjustment. I despise insecurity, can barely resist will to exploit bully crush the insecure.</div>
    <div>Have heard it said Joker disavowal is good spit test of rhetorical honesty, or of 30 yr old boomerness. That it weeds out fake frogs from real. IDK, but it does reflect an insecurity has been triggered, something deep threatened. Why else otherwise honest men resort to sophistry?</div>
    <div>Joker reviews are emblematic of the \"reject the same thing all normies reject, for same core reasons they reject it, but with face saved by 'elevating' the criticism thru some absurd, sophistic take; often a lie told to themselves as much their audience\" thing talking heads love.</div>
    <div>what am I kidding, I'm on the long side of history on all my takes. And only me.</div>
    <div>I'm on the long side of history here on this one, also, guys.</div>
    <div>Unironically struggle to understand why people assign anything more than marginal value to human life, especially relative to art. Stockhausen (rightfully) named 9/11 \"the greatest work of art\", and I'd gladly run it through a second time if the first had flubbed its live debut.</div>
    <div>And to see talk of \"consuming commercial product\" on my TL, from my beloved mutuals. Such pedantry, does it even warrant a response? Joker memes are a marketing campaign, u fell for it. Such pedantry, should I respond? Cinema is final realm of mass mythmaking. u r not above it.</div>
    <div>The RW, tho I love it, has serious paucity of aestheticism; no education of art world or its mechanisms, in any age. How left struggles to meme, right struggles to art: seek hamfisted ideologuery, beauty mutilated unto propaganda: mirror of their reconstructed kitsch aestheticism</div>
    <div>Ah yes. Other film did what I wanted the movie 2 be, but what it wasnt, better. So? The joker wanted, of cutting nihilist god, was done already in TDK. You got it. So? If u would've made the movie yourself... it would be different. That's bc u wouldnt make it. U would make rambo!</div>
    <div>BAP's crit falls very flat. Post-rationalization to justify his gut rejection; we know he disavow its ugliness, elevation of omega - but he sophistically sought 'interpretation' to discount it. Not like him but there it is. If u want tru nihilism, watch this. Who said we want it?</div>
    <div>When Joker said, \"You wouldn't get it\"? You felt that. Because he was talking about you. You didn't get it. Literally anyone who doesn't like Joker means they didn't get it, and their opinion has no value. This is canon. Joker's trick.</div>
    <div>Alphas on TL bullying frog omegas for finding role model in joker instead of generic movie chads. Not a good look and cringe as well. Why suddenly threatened by your autistic brethren? lol</div>
    <div>I am the only one in whole world with cognitive empathy to spare for the abused and disaffected of the web. Boundless love for the NEETs, autist elites, the omegamensch and peepeepoopoo posters. but if you're girl retard. Sorry, you're getting chained to the cage. No exceptions.</div>
    <div>I believe it's this lack of empathy with those who've suffered most under Society, a hubris defending only their own privileged selves, despite all projections to the contrary, which disgusts me most about the normie, the k-selected, the lib, the invaders gentrifying the internet</div>
    <div>Perhaps it requires trauma itself to be emotionally desensitized enough to not recoil at offense, to not burn at cruelty, to not fall prey to manipulative schemes; maybe, in their frailty, they're justified to silence their threateners. I'd rather see them become strong, as I am.</div>
    <div>Many will tell you that being mentally ill doesn't justify being rude, offensive, cruel, etc., which is how they justify their silencing while still claiming to be on the side of \"ableism\". They support the disabled so long it doesn't enroach on their own comfort. Very kind</div>
    <div>I believe the mental ill, that lonely type that stems from abuse/trauma, spends significant time 'screaming for help' online, and the normie-left spends significant energy silencing them, to ensure their own comfort, also boosting false 'depression/anxiety' LARPs as replacement.</div>
    <div>44. A exploit threatens Society, that the beat down loner nihilist shooter might become awakened omegamensch shooters: self-motivated, not baited by feds, hitting real targets &amp; infrastructure. Little they can do to stop this, yet many damage possible. Joker acts as figurehead.</div>
    <div>There's no argument against this. If there was any \"reactionary mass movement\", it's this: those self-actionable in the lower/middle class denying society's ills &amp; subjugations, perform social &amp; economic exit, recover meaningful status &amp; family. And trust me, the wives do follow</div>
    <div>When you're ready to begin a household, the challenge that lies in front of you is the same as all men that ever came before you, it's cliche but it's also that simple. It's fatherhood. It's raising your children with virtue, away from society's ills, bad influences. That's all.</div>
    <div>Western docs will seriously cry about supply chain, not enough masks, not enough “ventilators” while their ventilation systems dated to the 70s are readily transmitting airborne infection throughout every floor of their hospital. Look it up!</div>
    <div>43. Joker is the omegamensch; dark side of the ubermensch, who is commonly imagined only its alpha formation. Ignoble, frail, damaged, but powerful master of the self nonetheless. Omegas - the wizard, the poopoo peepee pepe - contain great seeds of power, too.</div>
    <div>42. Do not entertain any discussions on reality vs. delusion. This is normie cope, an out to refuse engaging with depicted possibilities contained within their reality. There is no ambiguity: all things shown in movie occurred, besides those that were firmly signaled as imaginary</div>
    <div>Only I am right, anyone disagreeing is wrong. Everything ITT is true, done by design, demonstrated by parallels in the narrative or in quotes from sparse dialogue. All will be vindicated by future amateur analysis, no need to waste breathe proving myself. Rewatch and u will see.</div>
    <div>The Joker's existence on film, its prominence in the public imagination, has already certified its status as hyperstitionally potentiated myth in some way or another inspiring whatevr incel shootings will inevitably occur. Whether they will organize into full uprising is unknown.</div>
    <div>40. Joker is a coup, in pitching low-budget character study of major IP, thus receiving massive signal boost despite lack of auditing of radical script shed of all its IP trappings, and it is subversive, in depiction of ubermensch manifestation &amp; exhortation of chaotic violence.</div>
    <div>39. The best joke in the film were the two “super rats” that trotted by in the backdrop as punchline to the Wayne family’s murder. This was a joke staged at the very beginning of the film on the news broadcast. The 2nd best joke was the Joker’s, on stage. He never went to school.</div>
    <div>38. Myths don’t care about your contemporary politics. The image of the wealthy out to the opera, embroiled in gilded decadence, a bloated aristocracy, evokes an anxiety that is as ancient as disease, as ancient as the first cities.</div>
    <div>37. Joker is a mythic archetype, or at the very least, a folk hero. He represents an inherent possibility in any society, a switch that can click for all with nothing: the alternative to suicide has always been the more terrifying one, for at least suicide occurs within society.</div>
    <div>36. Joker is neither a left or right wing film. Whatever commonalities it might appear share are coincidences, they are mere conditions producing Joker’s radicalization, or conversely, targets of his wrath—and its that which matters. Rest can be traded out without change.</div>
    <div>35. The infrastructure Joker lacked is not social services;it’s a father, a mother, a background, a functioning society. He was born into the social services and through it abused by his adoptee. Their defunding was his escape, not his trigger.</div>
    <div>33. Joker is not a nihilistic figure. He’s an ubermensch. People will resent this. The left hand path, his representation of ugliness, weakness, pain, is as of kali, in destroying a society. The right hand path, do note, works to build a new one — not preserve it.</div>
    <div>31. Many things that secure Joker as mythic. I won’t sink to realm of quote analysis, except one: the ending where he says you wouldn’t get the joke, thus certifying his alt culture manifest, incel uprising whose existence demonstrates successful exit of society, even jailed.</div>
    <div>30. With all significant events, of media, history, it serves everyone to interpret them in most mythic light possible, to coax story into legend. Joker could have made clear it was not a lone case of abuse that produced him, but society itself, not gov, but people. I say he did.</div>
    <div>29. There is subplot of government services being taken from Joker producing his rampage. This is not to suggest that healthcare could have saved society, just as criticism of rich not about class, but a pretense. It’s to show how thin the line is preventing an incel uprising.</div>
    <div>28. Joaquin achieves an impressive AIDS physique. Contrary to appearance, this is a feat of strength, an act of asceticism for the craft. It is important to demonstrate his body as a receptacle of society’s abuse. Crushed, sickly, weak under a society.</div>
    <div>27. It is canon that Joker killed the black single mom roastie following that scene he sat in her living room after killing his mother. Learn to read the subtext. He exterminated all single moms.</div>
    <div>26. One of the most important scenes is the dwarf's inability to reach the lock to escape Joker's murder scene. The audience is prompted to laugh, but in Joker's own empathy, after all his cruelty, they are made guilty, made most cruel -that is the punchline.</div>
    <div>24. If you don't sympathize with the Joker, our poor Joker, my king, you're the sociopath - not the other way around.</div>
    <div>23. The image of a clownfaced joker, dancing jubilantly, with a tear-stream running down his makeup, is the defining image of the trump incumbency micro-era. Stop trying to deny this.</div>
    <div>22. Society line is, in fact, said, and in full-form, at pivotal moment, live television, proclaiming a society is responsible for creating the Joker. This is not on accident.</div>
    <div>21. There are two plot-holes in Joker. 1. Somehow there is a recording of his comedy show, shared as if a contemporary viral video, despite the setting being in the 1930's. Second one, I forgot, but there is one more. This does not matter. Plot-holes are nothing more than trivia.</div>
    <div>20. Joker's trick is his dance, his glee. He presides over the destruction of a society with dancing glee, as Kali.</div>
    <div>19. Joker is not comic book movie &amp; should be considered outside trappings of its cringe origin. unfortunately made its way inside with few \"cameos\", but otherwise unmars the zeitgeist capturing kino. If u aren't moved by it you are outside the zeitgeist &amp; literally don't matter.</div>
    <div>18. Poor vs. Rich is subverted entirely to make the point of its meaningless pretense, one only defined by the press who misread his \"vigilante\" actions.He murdered the wallstreet playboys cause they jumped him, not bc privilege: it could have been the poor kids from beginning.</div>
    <div>17. The theme of the movie is not poor uprising against rich. It's disaffected mental illness realizing the power over a society his disaffection provides; nothing to lose, no morals to uphold, he, and his thousands of fellows, bitterly destroy with glee everything normies built.</div>
    <div>16. Joker is very sympathetic to mid functioning mental illness, which despite pretenses, the libs detest; and despite pretenses, is a uniquely white male plight. Even makes plot point out of roots being abuse of single mother, very common, rather than \"genetic\" illness cop-out.</div>
    <div>15. In other words, it's the press sensationalism that produces the riots and outpouring of support, the decentralized copy-cat rioting, laughing man-style, that radicalize the marginalized clown into the Joker, producing the clown vigilante they speculated.</div>
    <div>14. In this, the Joker was initiated by the press' own hand, who could have ignored the act altogether and let him continue to drift in invisibility, instead, quite poetically, they planned their own demise: tellingly, Joker manifests in full with murder of the big TV man.</div>
    <div>13. Meta to manufactured controversy surrounding the film, in (failed) attempt to hyperstitioniate an incel shooter; in buildup of aggressions resulting in Joker's snap, key trigger is validation for his 1st spree murder by press sensationalizing it as emblematic of class war.</div>
    <div>11. Make no mistake, the film is a power fantasy, and a convincing one. The Joker is highly sympathetic, his scenario highly plausible, and it will resonate with many heavily disaffected youth, any1 who realizes they have nothing to lose, and this clown world has nothing to save.</div>
    <div>10. Joker's point not untrue: if u have nothing left to lose, in a society that has forsaken u, abused u, tortured u...may as well perform violent chaos.. &amp; there is nothing they can do to stop u.. &amp; in that moment, you'll finally experience glee. Now do u see why they're afraid?</div>
    <div>9. Why so much backlash and FUD by the press class? The film depicts a revolution of the poor against a rich, who have lost touch with the common people; isn't this perfect fodder for lefty revolutionary fantasy? Literally antifa? No, for this one is real...</div>
    <div>8. Society line is, in fact, said, and in full-form, declaring a society is responsible for poverty and untreated mental illness. This is central theme of movie, and what has made our society literally shaking over it. Why? Because it's not only a complaint, but a call to action.</div>
    <div>7. The near total submersion of capeshit, besides few forced references to canon, makes a strong parallel to The Dark Knight; comic movie era ushered in by its grimdarkness, quickly subverted into normie ultra-cancer. Joker brings it full circle, to an end: comic movies are over.</div>
    <div>6. The skeleton plot makes it largely Joaquin's character study of Joker. The only side theme beyond untreated, disaffected mental illness is the comically simple rich vs. poor driving the revolutionary finale, which is subverted into an apolitical revelry of destruction.</div>
    <div>5. Film is structured as slow burner, very simple at its core, a buildup to meta-telegraphed explosion, series of (1) increasing traumatizations and severance from therapeutic services, which begin to overflow into (2) increasing external acts of violence as alternative outlet.</div>
    <div>4. Joker is not in fact an incel, but incel falls under the category which they lack the language to describe: severely disaffected white male. Incel are those whose traumatic insecurities manifest around specifically female-obsessive pathologies. Basically, the same.</div>
    <div>3. Anyone that tells you Joker is not an incel movie but a mental illness movie does not understand what the incel is: a romantic. He is incelibate of a life deserved to him, the chance for love. Sex, banal sex, is irrelevant; only a totem for pathologies of disaffection.</div>
    <div>Anyone that tells you Joker is cringe, hamfisted, bad etc. is lying to justify their uncomfortableness. It is competently produced, even well scored, and Joaquin successfully auteurs from below, as he always does. This is officially certified kino: no reviews, only commentary.</div>
    <div>1 RT = 1 commentary on Joker (certified official kino)</div>
    <div>Prole critical analysis is dominated by concept of spoiler. Serious value ascribed to plot twist. Imagine elevating plot to entertainment, or more, rather than its vehicle. Taught to think they care, but all twists fall emotionally flat, gimmick; &amp; movies r re-watched harmlessly.</div>
    <div>5. Model dilution of monthly trust fund payout over generations, assuming sons of sons only, accounting for inflation; and interest reinvestment/payout proportions needed to maintain relative value; and initial deposit required for financial independence(s) payout.</div>
    <div>4. Model relative ROI student loans dumped in LT investment; and long-term ROI trade school vs. bachelor's degree.</div>
    <div>3. Demonstrate ROI of children assuming rural living and directed into trade educations, accounting for net loss of daughters.</div>
    <div>2. Model total leverage in LT investment required to reach financial independence(s), including subsidization of costs of living in interim.</div>
    <div>1. Model investment required for self-sustaining financial independence at various class consumption levels.</div>
    <div>Noting down some financial independence models I intend to produce when I have more time. Careful study of my plans may enlighten you on a secret master plan.</div>

    <div>About to innovate new genre of meta-study: elaborate chains of correlations on correlations. Bad manners results in poverty, bc its corr. with ugliness is corr. with low income. Not a bit on correlation isn’t causation, it is, everything is interconnected. Holism. Gaia. One world</div>
    <div>But not for me tho</div>
    <div>Claiming authorship over content, feeling burned you didn’t get “credit” for your shitposts, is misguided hubris, profanes spirits of the network. Only spiritual redditors care about credit, and probably post cringe as well. People who steal tweets are performing civil service.</div>
    <div>Social sciences has contorted itself into a game of filling a great genetics shaped hole.</div>
    <div>Taxi Driver, Falling down, A Touch of Sin, Lesson of Evil. Progressively dominated by rampage sequence. If I had my hands on Cuck (2019), I would have made great reverie of murder on modest budget, with most barebone plot exposition to bookend campaign, and so achieve true kino.</div>
    <div>I don’t care if the protest is prog or alt nazi. I just want to meet girl. party. Area 51 raid, Dakota pipeline, Hong Kong, syria its all the same. I wonder if anyone cute saw me throwing this molotov cocktail. I felt so cool throwing this molotov cocktail. My life is a movie.</div>
    <div>I don’t care if the revolution is libtard or RW. I just want to go out in the streets n hurt people. I want to use the opportunity to break things, set fires, smash heads. With umbrellas or yellow vests or trucks or dodge chargers I don’t care. I’ll storm the radio station first</div>
    <div>people out there have never even touched the horn in their cars, because they're afraid the sound is too loud, they dont want to be obnoxious, attract attention. now I gotta hold down my horn for 5, 10 minutes straight while speeding down my highway, to fill in for their lapses.</div>
    <div>Make bad driving illegal and u ban minorities and women from the road. Make drunk driving illegal and u ban Bro Nite. Now Do U See?</div>
    <div>Perhaps I betray libertarian, or even..free citizen.. inclination, I do not know, but drunk driving law against spirit of American law, criminalizing state of mind behind act, not act itself. Already illegal to smash into streetlights, manslaughter: what difference if ure drunk?</div>
    <div>if you've never hollered at girls hanging elbow out from the passenger seat of your best friends slow ride, cigarette dangling from your mouth with an extra behind your ear, sunglasses on at night on main street, you're a spiritual virgin and probably european as well</div>
    <div>Only nu-males will disagree with this</div>
    <div>The bros means drunk in the theater, laughing freely with the bros drunk in the theater, texting group chat while driving on the highway, drunk driving, ogling high school girls behind sunglasses, sharing their nudes, eating steak burger while driving on highway. It is your right</div>
    <div>Without doubt I hold &amp; have witheld better taste than all, in all things. Am more charming, beloved, winner in all endeavors. from great lineage. apprenticed under great masters. lived life, performed great deeds. U must understand great depths of my humility in confessing this.</div>

    <div>Wow miya, that's cool I guess? It reminds me of the time a great thinker said -- no, not Nietzsche, the other one -- said, \"I am the source, each utterance its own citation\"................</div>
    <div>I praise those who hold the best music taste and do not listen to music, those who know the most theory and do not use jargon, those who have read great literature and do not reference it. At the end of the long road of aestheticism you find yourself before even the beginning.</div>
    <div>Self-trolling is irony for the blackpill era. self-troll is cool new thing. Think about it, why irony getting bad rap? Because its slippery and elusive, its defensive. People want to see pain, they want to see vulnerability. But you can't show weakness and be alpha. Hurt yourself</div>
    <div>Petite: prefers \"elevated\" televised \"dramas\". indulges in shallow mass media but must find something to better himself from peers\nElite: if he must indulge in mass media, its to appreciate media of masses, in its serialized dredges, and in this he is enlightened</div>
    <div>Thus, the self-awareness that so defines him in truth must be utilized only just enough to produce work, but not so much to lose his confidence. A delicate game.</div>
    <div>The conspiracy against the contemporary artist is that the self-awareness that defines him also holds the question that kills him: \"Why art?\" Why art? The answer is known, but acknowledging it destroys him, so it is submerged in so many distractions and dismissives.</div>
    <div>Art is not produced in a vacuum. The gallery does not simply host paintings, but informs future paintings made, in its curated representation. Record label, film studio, all enact deep influences on those artists represented, who begin to each meld together in their owner's image</div>

    <div>13. It is no coincidence that the conclusions of the topwit often align with the assumptions of the dimwit, what the midwit so confidently rejects. The dimwit is a vector of collective knowledge, and it takes topwit intelligence to reconstruct that. I shall now list examples.</div>
    <div>12. The topwit recognizes what the dimwit knows, that true knowledge will never be captured by the individual, a complete system will never be designed. That knowledge will at best be fuzzy, found in heuristics and intuition, best in the realm of wisdom.</div>
    <div>11. For the topwit, intellectualism is a pasttime, perhaps even an obsession. It's not a mere social image, as the midwit. The topwit cherishes the opportunity to learn from those with more knowledge, rather than scorns it. The topwit recognizes wisdom, too, blind to the midwit.</div>
    <div>10. The topwit, too, lives happily. His intelligence is distant enough from the median that he is beyond relying on innate superiority alone to give him his confidence in it, allowing it to be unhampered by petty social concerns and emotional insecurities.</div>
    <div>9. In contrast, the dimwit, who suffers from little intellectual insecurity, innocently relies on his gut intuition, and on the heuristic knowledge of his family and culture. Living uncritically, he suffers none of the pain the midwit self-inflicts through a misguided criticism.</div>
    <div>8. Midwit's middling intellectualism forces him to suffer great insecurity. Just smart enough to feel superior, not smart enough to be wise. He finds himself trapped in intellectual ditch, immobile defense from both sides by twin assumptions: stupidity, pseudo-intellectualism.</div>
    <div>7. \"The topwit may sound smart, but he does not make sense,\" midwit tells himself, rubbing the tears from his eyes. \"And dimwit listens to him, and he is a fool, and therefore, he is being fooled. Yes, being fooled by topwit. A grifter, of course! No one is smart, no one but me.\"</div>
    <div>6. The midwit cannot comprehend. He can't even see the difference between dimwit and topwit, blinded by his tears. He thinks they are both idiots, and from his encounter is convinced further of his intellectual superiority.</div>
    <div>5. \"HOW can I not understand this?\" the midwit screeches. \"YOU! are pretentious! THIS, does not make sense. Impossible! It is GIBBERISH!\"\n\nThe topwit sagaciously explains further, but to no avail. Midwit is crying now. But Dimwit? He follows his heart, and so stands with Topwit.</div>
    <div>4. The midwit lives assuming he knows more and knows better than all around him. This hubris is his ultimate failing, leaves him dumber than the dimwit, for when confronted with that which he can learn from, recognizing the opporuntunity, he, you may be surprised!, reels in pain.</div>
    <div>3. The midwit attaches himself to totems of conspicuous intelligence: science, rationalism, books. Whatever he can find to display flaunt superiority over the dimwit. He cannot grapple with the subjects to their ultimate conclusion, only serving to cultivate \"smart\" identity.</div>
    <div>2. The midwit is just smart enough to feel smarter than his peers, you see, but not enough to transcend his ego and achieve genuine sense of self-criticism; instead is inflated massively, tied desperately to early childhood sense of superiority. He is creature of great insecurity</div>
    <div>1. Midwits are the bane of society, cause great damage, worse than any simple idiot. Where the dimwit is dumb &amp; innocuous, dumb &amp; he knows it, the midwit is half-dumb and all the more dense for it. Here lies the Dunning-Kruger Effect, the Eternal Redditor, the \"ACKSHUALLY\" geek.</div>

    <div>Studies are form of fiction, or artistry (or performance?). The data can be coaxed to whatever necessary, within reason (satire, too, must not stretch too far). What fun: you make your case, anything at all, then go back &amp; find citations to prove it. Now you, too, are a citation!</div>
    <div>True shitposting involves entering a trance state, a lucidity ritual that serves to channel muse of the noosphere, draw out artifacts emblematic of the collective consciousness. Great truths manifest, self-organized in bouts of anonymous, ego-less shitposting.</div>
    <div>To post nonsense, and hope it be read with meaning. To indulge in broad strokes, emotives masquerade as surreality, whose self-reappraisal only follows other's commendation, in the reflections of their praise. And incidentally, to burn at their criticisms. False artistry of slave</div>
    <div>To be cringe, and post it anyway. To reflect on your cringe, with admiration. To indulge oneself as a literary glutton, with glee, to masturbate the ego in public, with pride. Is this not poetry? There is nothing more womanly than considering cringe in regards to loss of follower</div>
    <div>Inadvertent impenetrability thru casual use of various hyperlocalized e-slang &amp; memetic imagery as conceptual tools, in a para-academic replacement of jargon/theory, in deft navigation of contemporary noosphere, &amp; thoroughly cucking theoryfags out of relevance, is, in fact, based</div>
    <div>There is only one escape to a society. Embrace third way. Embrace edginess</div>
    <div>Sincere posters makes cringe times. \nCringe times make ironic posters. \nIronic posters make based times. \nBased times make sincere posters.</div>
    <div>All is cringe but edge is more based cringe than sincerity or post-ironic sincerity. To be sincere &amp; not be edgy is to be normie. To be edgy &amp; not sincere, a performance, is to be insecure. To be edgy, not on purpose, but sincerely, &amp; to know it, yet post anyway, is based.</div>
    <div>People recognize irony’s failure as absolving criticism at the expense of emptiness, and responded with “new sincerity” “post-irony” unabashed shameless cringe confessionals of the self. No. Answer is in removing the self who fears criticism, keeping self-awareness: post-edge.</div>

    <div>My dream is of an aural internet, of generated TTS of all info-streams droning in your ear, at your command, trained to 800 WPM, navigated and engaged with with a one handed chorded keyboard; or audio commands, maybe; or thought, fuzzily interpreted electromagnetic impulses.</div>
    <div>If only the internet was enforced to be standards-compliant, all things rendered fundamentally through a consistent text medium, it could then be consumed and navigated in every form possible - visual, audio, touch, speech, etc.</div>
    <div>The further expansion of the internet into total ubiquity is inevitable, and ideally would be done on the path of information-consumption, the internet as encyclopedia and global cloud DB - not how it’s currently been subverted to service manipulative consumption patterns.</div>
    <div>The Amazon AI assistant in-ear is good, actually, except for the AI assistant being designed with such unimaginative shortsightedness that it’s only functional uses are (1) check weather (2) set alarm (3) play music.</div>
    <div>My cryptoblog financial advise: anyone under 30 should be investing 150% or more of income in high-yield long-term investments, eg index funds, through debt leverage, such as your student loans.</div>
    <div>You lift so you may train your sons. You study so you may educate your sons. You live virtuously so you may guide your sons in virtue. Have many sons and let the gains compound, keep the wealth strictly within in the family, and you will be powerful.</div>
    <div>Gains maxing demands process of scientific self-experimentation. Deeply microethnic nature of body and its reaction to nutrition, training, etc - and the lack of research understanding this - means everyone must carve own path, one uniquely fit only to replicate in their sons.</div>
    <div>Why lift? If physical capital is uninheritable. Investment with returns in other domains - social, spiritual - but also: mental capital, uniquely most valuable to only your kin.</div>
    <div>Financial capital, social capital, spiritual capital, mental capital, physical capital; if it cannot be passed on to your legacy, it should only be considered leverage to obtain that which can. Income turned into land, reading turned into tutelage.</div>
    <div>All gains made are meaningless except that which can be passed on to your descendants, best that with the potential to perpetuate across indefinite generations. Without descendants the actual long term Future Value of your Present Value is null.</div>
    <div>Talk about 2016 on the TL. While you chan deserters were memeing on twatter, me &amp; the boys were making fuck you money in crypto. You lament lost frogs, tell story of great purges. You know NOTHING of the pain of 2017 crash. To be on top of world &amp; have everything taken from you..</div>
    <div>Sad truth is that the memes are true, millennials are a pathetic, lazy, feeble lot. They are incredibly risk-averse, terribly educated, suffer electronic addictions, medicated, psychologically traumatized, spoiled, undersocialized perennial loser virgins. Very easy to rise above.</div>
    <div>Boomers are absolutely not wrong about pulling yourself by the boot straps. Just having good attitude and work ethic and slightly above median IQ is valued about $50k starting, NO DEGREE, and with political acumen can get you to 6 figures in 5 years. Trades don’t even require IQ.</div>
    <div>I’ve mingled with the full-blooded American small town boomers. They’re all absolutely baffled by their children and the overall millennial generation, how weak-willed and feeble they are, how beat down and undersocialized, and egotistic, so quick to blame EVERYTHING on others.</div>
    <div>Ur Generation Cant Even Do A Full Working Week. Decide Whether You’re Boy Or Girl. Girl Or Alien. Eat Meat Without Crying. WAKE UP!!!</div>
    <div>This account respects boomerism in all its crass big balls glory. Millennials are undeniable virgin to the boomer chad. Blamig mom and dad for your poverty is slave morality and if you hate boomer for their boomerism, you are spiritual euro</div>
    <div>The population distributions in each income bracket match national IQ distribution. There is no poverty problem, it’s just a reflection of demographics. Import low castes and you’ll have more low class people. Import high caste, and you’ll have more high class people. Simple as.</div>
    <div>I do now confess plans to form a hyperborean reconstructivist settlement founded on a set of experimental cross-racial nu-ethnic castes (seeded by yours truly) and structured around a personally curated syncretic paganism: vedism, with elements of daoism and tengrism.</div>
    <div>Anyway, post-collapse you won't find me bunkering underground or hiding in mntn cabin. Not even in squadron of armored jeeps roaming midwestern plains, or running rust belt slave factory. No, I hope to reconquer North African coast, produce 1000 sons in history's greatest harem.</div>
    <div>There is very low-chance they will have subscribed to any read philosophy. Like all nations before them, they will rely on their intuition, on their blood-instinct. Success or failure is entirely a question of the strength of their caste. Racial purity alone will not help them.</div>
    <div>Post-collapse, in the global balkanization, there will be nothing enforcing patchwork, only eruptions of consolidated power in localities, that self-perpetuate or fail trying, which will be design of individuals &amp; their immediate ethnic tribes &amp; material reality of occupied land.</div>
    <div>Interest in politics as something you, peasant, may genuinely influence, have stake in, is base delusion perpetuated by democracy. Treating it as intellectual debate, hypothetic for potential future efficacy is still delusional, bc systems will not be instilled but self-organize.</div>
    <div>The question of religiosity is also a question of blood purity - not society, not government, and not simply racial demographics. If ruling class is noble, pure, saintly and rightfully taking lead as masters, everything will fall in place and the peasantry, too, will be virtuous.</div>
    <div>Trads and righties focus too strongly on basic racial purity, but not the blood quality of castes within them. The damage of miscegenation applies to intercaste marriage as it does interracial. Leads them to focus too strongly on political systems, when it all derives from blood.</div>
    <div>Political systems don't matter, they evolve in response to material circumstances &amp; their efficacy is a direct reflection of ruling caste's quality. The system that matters is that which controls marriage and descendance, which maintains racial purity, especially of ruling caste.</div>
    <div>Instagram, telegram, &amp; many twitter &amp; Facebook accounts, exist only to accidentally service this missing need of a memesharing DB/community. Coders no longer have the agency to produce solutions to software needs anymore, only rely on creative misuse of SV’s commercial software.</div>
    <div>Wymen and wine moms will knock her, but they're most deeply frustrated because they knows she's right. Her reaction is the pragmatic and natural one; only damage is caused by her own runaway paranoia. Slave-led modernity bends to serve female jealousy; it should be reined in.</div>
    <div>If there were even 1 hacker alive today he would be coding a great digital ecosystem of self-modifying viruses, evolving organically, aimless on world's spare bandwidth. In future years, algos &amp; heuristics of the many species will be studied to discover new programming paradigms.</div>
    <div>The state of coding, security, the web: abysmal, a joke; extremely vulnerable, inefficient. It will not be fixed without being forced to be fixed. IPA codecucks don't have the balls to play gadfly anymore, and greed-motivations kept complacent by fat yuppie paychecks.</div>
    <div>Uncomfortable truth is the only future for autistic NEET incels is being memetically manipulated into suicide. If you don't lead them at least towards heroic terrorism, you're complicit in their drugged self-castration into leftist sexual plaything followed by suicide.</div>
    <div>Perk up, NEETS! Hear my call. Here is your chance to ride in the sun. Take to the streets and strike terror into those who scorned you! The debt must now be paid for their cruelties. Give them chaos and take the only thing they hold dear: their comfort. They can't stop all of us!</div>
    <div>The shootings will continue, and they will get more sophisticated. The manifestos will become more eloquent, more inspirational, more viral. Kill counts, how primitive, will give way to social disruption, financial damage. Why shoot children when you can take down the internet?</div>
    <div>The incel extremist movement will manifest anonymously and leaderless, self-organized explosions of pent-up virility. Nothing can stop the bitter nothing to live for NEET from actioning on his nihilism if only for a weaponized memetic identity, one kindly provided by journos.</div>
    <div>You can each be your own Nietzsche—penning aphorisms with ideas, and jokes, drawn from meditations, from founts of disdain, ecstasy, but nothing resting on any literary canon. Why so many ask for my source? It comes from within. I am the source, each utterance its own citation.</div>
    <div>Europeans are a sorry, beaten lot. America may have been usurped by great miscegenation, but the American still reappears in full purity often. Euros, however, are soul-tainted by deep-seated leeches. Their blood itself is corrupt. A lost continent with very few men of note.</div>
    <div>Yes, we all know the horror stories about UK’s forced vaccinations, censored wrongspeak, illegal drawings &amp; web histories, confiscated dinner knives, protected minorities, even Irish fluoridation. But did you know you need ID verifying 18+ to purchase books that aren’t YA fic?</div>
    <div>Did you know you can be jailed for being outside after 3am in urban areas of Belgium? These are all true, you can look them up. It’s illegal to swim on the Dutch coast except in privately owned sections or with special permit. France has banned non-commercial fishing, hunting.</div>
    <div>In Sweden, your kids will be taken away if raised in contradiction with government instructed standards. The Swedes have also made it illegal to smoke cigarettes. I don’t mean inside restaurants or bars, it’s illegal to smoke in the entire country, including your own home.</div>
    <div>In Switzerland, it’s illegal to drive a car older than 2006, for climate change reasons. They started with buy-backs but now it’s just illegal. Areas of Germany ban driving diesel altogether. In Australia, spiritual european unionists, owning gold is banned and gets confiscated.</div>
    <div>There are many things lame man Europe kept hidden from Americans. Norway has liquor price-floors. Beer is no less than $5/can to “fight drunk driving”. The French forbid any cash payment over $1000, to oppose “drug money laundering”. German savings accounts have negative interest</div>
    <div>And options open on each tweet's virality, or lack thereof. I want bets laid down on every movement, I want every action a financial decision. All software until now has been a stepping stone to universal crypto-capitalism. You will live to have your every metric traded.</div>
    <div>That \"Software is eating the world\" as a social phenomenon distinctively begins ground zero in Greater L.A. was most iconically identified in Heat's knowing line abt info-streams in the air. GTA V was positioned to demonstrate it, embody it. Instead it settled for mere reference.</div>
    <div>Temperature relates to elevation + distance from equator. Humidity relates to coast distance + blocking elevations. Biome relates to temperature + humidity. Natural resources relate to biome. Economy relate to resources. Settlements relate to economy. Trade relate to settlements.</div>
    <div>Meditating on algorithms. Inbetween algorithms, there is god. How to world gen: Set sea level &amp; RNG general land elevation. Draw plate tectonics. Mountains, higher elevation, on plate lines. Rivers amble from mountains to ocean. Valleys, lower elevation, form by rivers &amp; coast.</div>
    <div>Thinking about GTA 5, was primed to be the ultimate artwork of the 21st century, Gravity's Rainbow for my contemporaries. It's so obvious in hindsight, post-Silicon Valley Los Angeles can only be understood in the lens of algorithmic satire. An artwork entirely failed. I weep</div>
    <div>If you don't get capped &amp; spread, if you don't get your OC falseflagged as pasta, if you don't get imitated and reduplicated into ultra-autistic recursive oblivion, or if you BECOME the pasta (rather than your distinctive pathos redistributed like so many laughing men), you lose.</div>
    <div>The women have hidden many great secrets from you. I’ll share only one example: periods tend to synchronize and occur at the same time with any group of women spending significant time together. This is something all women know and have experienced, but few men will ever know.</div>
    <div>Algorithmically generated music will replace the experimental, avant-garde genres first - noise, techno, black metal, etc. - and replace pop music last, long after classical has been fully outmoded. This will be entirely due to technical difficulty. Take from this what you will.</div>
    <div>\"Traducir Tweet\" The acc right is a latinx movement</div>
    <div>I dream of a world with art but no artists, sports but no players, economies but no businessmen. I dream of a world with slaves, liberated by their subjugation, and masters, liberated by their subjugations. I dream of suffering with no sufferers. Of humanity, but no men.</div>
    <div>My slave is my self-driving car. Slave is my smart light, smart home. My cook, my thermostat, the one who knows my tastes and schedule so well. Slave is my secretarial assistant, slave is my audio/visual entertainment, slave is always at my side. I love slave.</div>
    <div>Thought experiment for open-minded progressives: consider if all the great advancements of human technology has at all furthered urban middle class life's day to day convenience more than it was set-back by the withdrawal of slavery's prolific, zero-cost human labor. It has not!</div>
    <div>Thinking about content creators. Aesthetic production in the shadow of mass artificial intelligence, trite proto-imitation of machine arts to come. Done almost in veneration of their destroyer, true act of banality, and in its self-denial, extremely and pathetically human.</div>
    <div>Let a cut of the revenue go to he who set up the infrastructure. Or maybe efficiency will reduce them to operating at-cost? Nothing does in scale, only near at-cost... that shred of margin? Let it pile up, forever, untouched...so many little ritual tithes to the machine economy.</div>
    <div>Automated companies will be here shortly, all generic production will be it: discreet, end-to-end machine factories. Local coffee roaster? No one need be present. Furniture shop, record label. Order arrives, machine wirrs, product packaged &amp; pushed thru mailslot for the postman.</div>
    <div>And when your every indice is traded on public exchanges, valuation at service to speculation, you will understand the transmogrifying power of hyperstition.</div>
    <div>Markets will eat the world. All metrices will be traded and speculated. Your salary, your friendcount, your lifespan. Your personal budgeting, your lifestyle decisions. All information public, objective and measured - all information, soon enough - is open for options.</div>
    <div>Speak not of attention economies, but markets. View-time not harvested, but bought &amp; sold. Followers, subscriptions: traded like slaves. Imagine: reputation markets, speculated on like stocks.. w paradoxical recursion on the famous.. Your precious data, their metrics, my market.</div>
    <div>You will live to see markets beyond your comprehension. Anything that can be measured can be traded. Everything is code, BTC is capitalism in the form of code = everything is capitalism. This is good thing, because markets' consilience is the only truth.</div>
    <div>I praise those who want to marry and do not, those who want to sail off and do not, those who want to be active in affairs of state and refrain from doing so, who want to educate children and do not, who begin to type a message in the group chat and hold off.</div>
    <div>100. This world is coming to an end. We are living out the last days of the Kali Yuga. All things the vedas told of have come to be. Take solace in the knowledge that all this has happened before and it will happen again.</div>
    <div>97. Sources are a bourgeois concern. All evidence finds itself resting on other evidence, which, when chased to its ultimate source, is always finally a perception - same as your own. Only correct responses to citation request is: (1) it is internally known, or (2) sacred texts.</div>
    <div>96. Dynamic media - film, music, games - are easily and widely encoded by hypermanipulations that rot the brain. It's only worth consuming the most raw, programmatic, fundamentalist works, or better yet, stick entirely to the static mediums, whom may actually wield beauty.</div>
    <div>95. Writing is a form of thinking. Understand this, not only so it may be utilized as leverage for your thought, but also to recognize that external monologue alone is not much noble: literature, and its non-fiction equivalents, are edited into existence, not simply written.</div>
    <div>Mask off... subjugation is great fun, too. Go ahead, you earned it, king.</div>
    <div>Many people reading this will have never experienced it, or only secondhand. The ugliest of these lessers are even tortured by it. Insecure and self-hating, they cannot admit themselves unto adoration so instead bitterly burn themselves in the brightness. Not my fault.</div>
    <div>I've sometimes been struck observing the face of ultra granular ethnics, those professional villagers, worked to the bone, who carry full weight of history in the lines of their face. The deep time present in their every steady movement is what rituals seek to transport you to.</div>
    <div>Basics speak of the vastness of nature... of feeling (one) God in the wildies, of stars and mountains, how their reflection makes ME...humble. They know nothing of ancient sediments packed for millenia, rivers carving valleys. That gods are found in the migration of birds...</div>
    <div>Skincare quick notes: grapeseed oil base of most skin cosmetics. Rub it on your body &amp; tan. Sunbathing your balls produces hyper T gains. Exfoliating body scrub is all you need to make skin metallic smooth. And vitamin B3 (Niacin) oil on the face will make you glow like an angel.</div>
    <div>Once a day I'll find the time to meditate, perform bodyweight exercises (1 set to exhaustion) (nude, in the sun), and recite verses from memory. My natural resting position is a power pose. I drink merrily each night. Most importantly, I have sex 2-3x a day but only finish once.</div>
    <div>I fast one week a month and otherwise eat primarily meat, fermented vegetables, mushrooms, butter and spices. I also drink heavy amounts of coffee, chew nicotine gum and microdose LSD 3 times a week. I take a raw ACV w turmeric and cayenne shot and 1 garlic clove every morning.</div>
    <div>Hackers are dead and the codecucks killed them. Never take down software. Leak everything to the public when threatened. Aggressively disrespect people's wishes. Intentionally uncredit works or blur the authorship and ownership. Information must be liberated.</div>
    <div>Content creators fear the deepfake. Their time in the twilight, primitively imitating AI to come, is coming to an end. Soon even their persona-identities will be lost to them. They can only suppress it for so much longer. The tyranny of dynamic media is ending.</div>
    <div>94. We live in a media age. This means that consensus, not personal, belief is reality. There is no functional difference between a falsified event believed than a real one believed. The false is real.</div>
    <div>93. Bot accounts proliferate throughout the web today. These are being invested in by government agencies. Many of the normies on social networks such as this one do not actually exist in real life. The question of whether they do or do not is quickly becoming meaningless.</div>
    <div>92. Homosexuals reproduce through pedophilia.</div>
    <div>91. Music is sacred, and it is being profaned by the modern tendency to play it constantly. I would advise only enjoying it live.</div>
    <div>90. The metric system is only useful for objective measurements: in engineering. The imperial system is far more useful as a day-to-day standard, as it's intuitively anthropocentric. It's entirely based on the human body or experience. Midwits cannot comprehend this.</div>
    <div>89. Books should be experienced physically. Reading is a physical experience, and your memory will benefit from it.</div>
    <div>88. Stress and fear can be harvested. You are being farmed.</div>
    <div>87. The body is more malleable than you know. It can be effected by will alone. The effects of the external environment on the physical body are purely internal, and adrenaline can be utilized to perform superhuman feats.</div>
    <div>86. Women absorb some of the DNA from the man of every man that finishes inside them, forever effecting their genetic record, and their minds. This is why the unmarried non-virgin is a whore. However, sperm swallowed extends their life, and, rubbed into the face, their beauty.</div>
    <div>85. As virgin does not apply to men, friendship does not apply to women. There are no female friendships, only mothership and competition. Women also experience no romance, but they do obsession and sublimation.</div>
    <div>84. Virginity only applies to females. The loss of it is the defining moment in their life, a deep trauma that forever affects her brain. She is forever marked by her first partner. For men, the first time is not meaningful, as are all his partners. “Male virgin” is an oxymoron.</div>
    <div>83. At a macro-level, all human relationships are organized by (1) caste and (2) gender. All gender and caste dynamics can be understood by studying (1) ethnicity (2) reproductive incentives (3) material resources.</div>
    <div>82. Polygyny is the natural structure of high caste relationships. Monogamy is necessary for low castes because the overly masculine men are unable to handle the nuance of managing a harem of women.</div>
    <div>81. Natural expression of masculinity and feminity vary by caste, with the lower castes tending towards more exaggerated displays of either, and the higher tending towards more nuanced unions. Low caste gender ideals dominate the modern west, leaving high castes deeply confused.</div>
    <div>80. Mass consensus is the best predictor &amp; consilience the best standard of evidence. As the tyranny of media-as-truth collapses, these will be your tools moving forward. You may note the former is the mechanism of anonymous imageboards, the latter the method of conspiracy theory</div>
    <div>79. Trauma acquired in life can be passed down to descendants. Curses too.</div>
    <div>78. Man’s origins lie as the hybrid offspring of a female chimpanzee and a male pig. Hybridization drives much of biological evolution.</div>
    <div>77. Ancients did not die at age 40. This is a statistical misunderstanding. “Life expectancy”, as an average, is dragged down by the high rate of infant mortality in periods predating sanitary urban conditions. After the age of 2, many ancients lived to 70-80. Many lived to 100.</div>
    <div>76. HIV isn’t real. Never been isolated, can’t be tested for. AIDS isn’t real. It’s just GRID, a lifestyle phenomenon, on one end, and dysentery, a WHO fabrication, on the other.</div>
    <div>75. Viruses are responsible for evolutionary mutation. Parasites are persistent influences across human society. Some are so powerful to retrain neural responses, manipulate reproduction rates. Also, viruses, parasites &amp; evolution, as concepts, need not be necessarily biological.</div>
    <div>74. Gut biomes are hyper-ethnic. The diet that works for you is the one that works for your fathers, but maybe not your cousins and definitely not your cosmopolitan neighbors. Grandma reconstructivism and trial &amp; error is the way. If you’re true Aryan blood, eat the aryurvedas.</div>
    <div>73. Corruption of science aside (not the two are separable), most nutrition science is unusable even with the Method’s own tenets, because diets are highly sensitive to the gut biome, as well as genetics. Any study that doesn’t control for these factors is largely useless.</div>
    <div>Autogenerate a Jordan Peterson deepfake podcast and upload to soundcloud bot instead of “thread unrolling” when?</div>
    <div>71. Garlic clove eaten raw once a day keeps the doctor away. This is a hard pill to swallow, but only at first, for the same reason it’s worth doing, for the same reason cold exposure and fasting are. Not to shock, but to harden.</div>
    <div>70. Nothing is political. All things are spiritual.</div>
    <div>69. Any canon that ignores the spiritual power of sex is imperfect. Cherish your cum.</div>
    <div>68. Mating between the two descendant races often resurfaces hyperborean traits through the mechanism of atavistic regression. This will not be studied.</div>
    <div>67. Arya is the first son of the hyperboreans, but his sister, the Turan, is often forgotten. Where Aryans conquered southwards, Turanics travelled eastwards. The eternal daoist canon is their most preserved spirituality.</div>
    <div>66. Miscegenation is the great destroyer of knowledge. This is how we know knowledge is stored in the blood.</div>
    <div>65. Caste is always racial and stratifies on miscegenation grounds, ratios between hyperborean and aboriginal ancestry, between conqueror and conquered. This is universal.</div>
    <div>64. The Vedas originate in the Arctic circle penned by the hyperboreans themselves. It is the most complete literature to exist on our ancient spirituality. All other paganism are imperfect descendants of this tradition, melded with the aboriginalism of conquered lands.</div>
    <div>63. Multiple species of man walk this earth. All noble achievement traces itself to the Hyperboreans, whose earthly origins are found in the Arctic Circle. Their many ruins may still be found, but they’re being systematically destroyed by another great race, one fallen &amp; ignoble.</div>
    <div>62. Most of our history is fiction. The timeline extends far longer than is commonly suggested, and all the technology we know today has previously existed before, and more. We live in a dark age.</div>
    <div>61. There exist many, many, many vegetables and fruits. More than you will ever know. This is the greatest secret kept hidden from the public. If you think there is simply the apple, the peach, you are mistaken.</div>
    <div>60. Adding lanes to the highway only increases incentive to make use of it. Traffic will not adjust. Paid lanes, however, work. Ideally, all highways would be tolled, at rates set to maintain optimal speed. Keeping the masses out is the solution to many modern problems.</div>
    <div>59. There is never a reason to be made to stand in line. It’s a consequence of poor logistics and unrestricted masses. It’s undignified. It’s inhumane. Some people are proud to “queue up” willingly. What does this tell you about them?</div>
    <div>58. Man was made to work. In work, he is freed. Take it away from him and he imprisons himself, and miserably so. Consider the NEET. The aristocracy so envied by the masses has finally been obtained, and it’s killing them.</div>
    <div>57. Freedom is a terrible burden. It crushes all but the noble. The weakling detests his freedom, for it reveals his own failings. He detests himself, and the prison he builds for himself is far worse than anything his master would have.</div>
    <div>56. Elevator boys, taxi’ists and other peasantry who can, through the nature of their service, forcibly subject you to their middling conversation is abuse &amp; unacceptable &amp; engaging with it is NOT cute or worldly. That your GF thinks it’s is how I know we live in the Kali Yuga.</div>
    <div>55. To think untouchables deserve the same living standards as their betters is not only laughable, it’s sinful. There is no good in class subversion: they will be the ones punished for rejecting their place, not those who enforce it, for karma relates to accordance with dharma.</div>
    <div>54. Many people were simply born to be slaves. They don’t have value on this earth except as servants, worth only to operate as gears in a great machine. Societies fail that fail to uphold this.</div>
    <div>53. Many peoples are not really human. Many are born without souls or lose them following extreme trauma. These are empty vessels and can be used as you wish without karmic consequence. To damage souls, to traumatize, however, is a great sin.</div>
    <div>51. It is no coincidence the traditional method - heuristics - is what's used to train artificial intelligence. What was performed over centuries through culture (and over millenia in biology) may be digitally emulated and thus accelerated. Generations compact into CPU cycles.</div>
    <div>50. Tradition is fundamentally capitalist. Understand this and you understand both.</div>
    <div>49. The traditional method is simply iterated heuristics trialing. Where science seeks to understand mechanism, tradition seeks result. The former's prospective elaboration leads to unintended consequences, retrospective meditation on the latter leads to holistic understanding.</div>
    <div>...With each new paradigm spawned, it becomes more and more obvious that each step further is only a stumble backwards towards the start they rejected. Is science a hubristic denial of our senses, or a cult to it?</div>
    <div>48. They wouldn't know it, but science's goal, in trying to find an accurate abstraction of known reality, is simply an attempt to independently reconstruct the sensory apparatus we've received over a millennium of trial and error heuristics....</div>
    <div>....A new paradigm is designed, specifically to resolve the contradictions of the previous, and the game runs on, endlessly, in the Borgesian hope that eventually a model will be obtained that perfectly models reality. It is this, and nothing more.</div>
    <div>47. Let us demystify the blind game of science, the game played by erecting abstract models of the world whose boundaries are then tested to see where they fail to match reality, until the fiction becomes so unsustainable to break the illusion of meaningfulness....</div>
    <div>46. Most claims to producing health by modern medicine are stolen and undeserved. The great advances in health are entirely due to hygiene: in sewers for the city, in sanitized delivery in childbirth. Western medicine actually practiced is the greatest killer of modern man.</div>
    <div>45. Most disease is anthropic in origin. Myopia, sleep apnea, obesity, ugly people, adhd, depression, anxiety - all accidental syndromes produced in the pursuit of modernity. This is not a new trend. Disease itself is the product of sedentary agriculture. This is where man fell.</div>
    <div>44. Advances in gut &amp; virus research have revealed the human as a nondiscreet entity, advances in genetics have revealed our fatalism. Man is commanded by parasites from within &amp; without &amp; stands host to multiple consciousnesses. YOU is the most parasitic &amp; least powerful of all.</div>
    <div>43. Man has no center. That which he wishes to reject most, the banality of his reproductive existence, is the only constant available. The only meaning to be found is in persistence, and the only persistence is in descendence.</div>
    <div>41. Man was domesticated by  wheat. How did this happen? Some Thing has domesticated biology...</div>
    <div>40. Agriculture was a mistake. Agriculture wasn't a mistake, it wasn't our choice. Agriculture was the greatest cruelty inflicted on man. Consciousness was the mistake.</div>
    <div>How upset u are by me exactly tracks how much above u I am. Every step I’m higher than u is exactly one step more upset u will be, u must understand this.</div>
    <div>39. The animals are intelligent. Animals have personalities, they have emotions. Goats play pranks, did you know that? Crows hold court. Elephants mourn. Pigs knows suffering.\n\nThis is the truth, and here is my commentary: I imagine they must feel pity for us.</div>
    <div>38. The internet is an exocortex, is an information feed. It is NOT for socialization, you are using it WRONG. All online socialization is abusive, is traumatic. Alters are constructed as abuse receptacles and in your naivety you reabsorb it into your identity. Stop this.</div>
    <div>37. Most coders have no idea how to use a computer, also. This is because they are coders, and not hackers. The internet is bad, but it doesn't have to be. But it does, because the hacker is dead, and the coders killed it.</div>
    <div>36. Speaking of gamers, women can never learn to use a computer for the same reason they can't drive a car or work a sailboat: no technics.</div>
    <div>35. Good videogame graphics don't matter. The photorealism spectacle wears off after first few hours of play. Game design's hardware ceiling was broken decades ago. It's exclusively forced to justify the artificial generation cycle. A marketing gimmick. You've been trained, gamer</div>
    <div>33. I know an out, though, but you won't like it. The only damper on capitalistic self-organization is the destruction of resources - be it either human or natural. Efficiency seeks to eliminate arbitrage; nuclear missiles &amp; biogenetic viruses will soon reach a DIY price point...</div>
    <div>32. Capitalism, or capitalism's God, will build AI, not humanity. As it built the industrial revolution, as it built the agricultural revolution. This one replace us. This is the most obvious pill in the thread but the one most will choke on.</div>
    <div>31. Capitalism is a material dynamic, not a human structure. Market competition is ever-present in nature. Like most material complexity, it's a product of self-organization towards the ultimate goal of efficient equilibrium. This is non-negotiable.</div>
    <div>30. Taste is taught. Taste is social. Taste is not internal. There is no subjectivity except as it relates to class.\n\nGood taste, by the way, is found in the gut, not the head.</div>
    <div>29. Information must not be monetized. The grand patent experiment has failed, misunderstanding both the incentives and needs of \"invention\", has only strangled it. Only when all digital content is freed will noospheric entities grace us. Not to get ahead of myself...</div>
    <div>28. Some things are delivered to us from the beyond. Jokes, art and technology. One carries knowledge, one carries beauty, and one carries suffering. But we are getting ahead of ourselves now...</div>
    <div>27. Authorship is often misunderstood. The \"author\" is not the author, but merely The Author's tool. He is wielded by a force unknown. He is the midwife, the assistant in creation. Yes, he may leave some of his mark, in his imperfection. But what of the mark left on him?</div>
    <div>26. Grave tones often substitute substance. Many knowledge is lost through seriousness. Except in matters of literature and theater, pay attention to the witty, and the witty alone.</div>
    <div>25. Jokes are always meaningful. All funny things are worth acknowledging. All jokes are worth cultivating. You may have noticed that humor arrives from a place unknown. Many knowledge can only be conveyed through a punchline.</div>
    <div>24. Rationality often fails against instinct. Do not fall for its charms. Intuition, their synthesis, stands tall above both.</div>
    <div>23. Text is the only robust medium. Work produced anywhere else, except perhaps oil painting, is pitifully temporary. Why waste your precious time appreciating the works of any artist or thinker who themselves has thrown them out into the temporary?</div>
    <div>22. Writing is a form of thinking. Writing is the best form of thinking. Internal monologue, on the other hand, is bourgeois.</div>
    <div>21. Reading any commentary is a vice, a guilty pleasure. Or maybe, it’s a handicap. Or maybe, it’s a crutch, that should be thrown away when you no longer need it. What is commentary? All writing besides the sacred texts.</div>
    <div>20. Philosophy, like debate, is a game of sophistry. In this solitaire, you post-rationalize your present desires as convincingly as possible. It’s only to convince yourself, but pedants will still read you.</div>
    <div>19. Non-local politics, too, are a pasttime, and this one is a sport you watch, not one you play. Don’t confuse yourself.</div>
    <div>17. Fasting is difficult because for mental and spiritual reasons, not physical, because it denies your desire. This is why it expands time.</div>
    <div>16. It is not time that’s limited. Time is cheap and can be multiplied easily. It’s unfulfilled desire that you regret.</div>
    <div>15. Any esoteric that claims adepthood but cannot manifest either wealth or women when desired is powerless and should not be trusted.</div>
    <div>14. Women do not think like men. They don’t think rationally at all. They are reactive, emotional sophists whose changing thoughts are tied to the moon, to her hormonal cycle. This is the key to understanding women and understanding women is the key to understanding the universe.</div>
    <div>13. Sex with a condom on is not sex. The fluid transfer is essential. The lube required by so many circumcites also serves to dilute this. Incidentally, feeding a woman your seed will let you mind control her. Learn her cycle.</div>
    <div>12. Speaking of developmental trauma, circumcision greatly dampers your ability to pleasure in two ways: making the soft head rough, and dulling your sensitivity. The infantile trauma also shocks the soul.</div>
    <div>11. Blood is king over all. Your personality, thoughts, and actions are genetic by default. Environment only interferes in the case of developmental neglect or trauma. All societies stratify by caste for this reason.</div>
    <div>10. Materially speaking, wealth is very easy to manifest. Only your personal quality prevents it -  poverty is deserved. The class you find yourself in is the caste you were born into, and the caste your sons will be born into. Contentment means accepting this.</div>
    <div>9. Speaking of tradition, polite manners are the lubricant of society. They are each designed to minimize abrasiveness in social interaction. Teenage pedants will criticize them as pointless rituals, yet meditate on any, and you will eventually uncover a deeply valid purpose.</div>
    <div>8. Science is almost all wrong. The scientific method is inaccurate, inefficient, rambling, unreliable &amp; high time preference. The products of science should never be actioned on. Traditionalism, however, is robust, accurate and purposeful. You can rely on it without hesitation.</div>
    <div>7. Doctors are dumb, actually. Their field demands only rote memorization of data and procedures. Like women, some may be smart, but none are intelligent. They are also wrong &amp; hippocritical, they only harm and do not heal, but you already knew that.</div>
    <div>6. The egg yolk, raw, is the best part. The fish eyes, the orange rinds. Eat the brain of the crab, the shell of a shrimp. Suck the marrow out of every bone.</div>
    <div>5. Wine and chocolate are also good for you. This is true of most of life’s pleasures. Women are good for you, for example. But not avocados.</div>
    <div>4. Tobacco is good, actually. Raises test, lowers stress, productive habit formation, women will always find it attractive, punctuates conversation, punctuates the day, produces a noir aura, provides moments of contemplation. That smoking causes lung cancer, by the way, is a lie.</div>
    <div>We are creatures of habit. Our thoughts, actions and reactions derive from unconscious, internal heuristics. Observe an individual with damaged ganglia, the mind's habit center: dysfunctional. Most pathologies, depression most obviously, are self-reinforcing habit feedback loops.</div>
    <div>1 retweet = 1 mundane yet hard to swallow r*dpill</div>
    <div>What is a woman?\n \n*flings wine glass*\n\nA miserable pile of hormones!!</div>
    <div>The woman does not exist. There are daughters who come of age and become a mother-wife. And throughout they never give up the role of child, for the wife is her husband's child, to him as their children is to her. Here within lies the secrets of woman.</div>
    <div>Thus, the family blood in any home is found in only the men and children. The mothers are aliens. The household lives only in the men, and continues only in the sons. All patriarchy follows, in the robustness of tradition.</div>
    <div>The foundations of patriarchal misogyny are ascertained by the logistics of households. The daughter leaves her father's home for her husband's and enters the new family, taking on the family name. Ties to her old family are cut, for her husband replaces her father.</div>
    <div>Thinking about white girls fuck dogs microchimerism</div>
    <div>KPOP is a mass henotheistic movement. KPOP is touhou for zoomers. KPOP is for all the fat &amp; brown teens worldwide. But KPOP is NOT for malaysian muslim supremacists!!!</div>
    <div>The infrastructure for robustness, FYI, is trivial: federated protocols and decentralized cryptocurrency function unrestricted. Unfortunately, they limit the capacity for grift, and miss that easy exit, not anti-censorship, is what’s actually needed for rewilding the social web.</div>
    <div>Why, yes, I'm a fedposter AND I am NOT your trad mommy -- so please stop self-doxxing in my DM's!!\n\nImagine participating in a revolutionary movement formed of such an ignoble stock that they can only commit to heroic violence when bolstered by (doxxable) social prodding.</div>

    <div>The borgesian prison, grown so large to have its own heirachies, culture and lifestyle, society within a society: our great miscegenation has produced so large an untouchable caste that they live unknowingly within an underworld, lifetime unexposed to even a glimmer of nobility.</div>
    <div>Perhaps the resentment they hope to deliver at their nobles is being directed at their fellows crabs who have crawled out of the bucket; the only designer they know is the \"designer\" sold to the tasteless low-castes. They cannot even begin to ID the elites they hope to critique.</div>
    <div>And let us provide them a windfall and see where their REAL virtue takes them... oh? It's been lost in no-status class aspirational grasping: falling for designer label's mass market lines, all brand and no quality (what quality would they know?).</div>
    <div>Hapas are the Traditionalist race par excellence. Let us recall: mixing two distantly related groups produces atavistic regression to the progenitor; Aryan + Turanic = Hyperborean! Brothers, their study is essential to our ancestral reconstruction!</div>

    <div>PLEASE stop liking and retweeting this is a serious question! The bulbous nose, inflated lower lip, dark eyes, raised hairlines, facial pudge... We are observing a distinct ethnic phenotype - the square framed glasses are undeniably physiognomic expression. Wot means?</div>
    <div>“Cheating”, like “virginity”, is a concept that sensibly applies only to women. On the other hand, “friend” applies exclusively to men. These are the facts.</div>
    <div>Feminism begins with male monogamy. Dismantlement of the nobleman’s harem is modernity’s most dysgenic corruption.</div>
    <div>Web demography is increasingly coalescing into a duality - the incel: sexually inverted, feminity moderated by hatred, woman sterilized; and the tranny: sexually exploded, femininity worshiped by imitation, female debasement unleashed. All else occurs between these warring poles.</div>
    <div>Misogynist incels are graduates of the libidinal economy. They combat female sexual desire with its inverse: its hatred. They're a moderating force, an essential balance to the web's psyche that is now needed more than ever.</div>
    <div>Misogynist incels are the strongest race online. They transcend the sexual attention game that dominates the gentrified internet, which middling incels fall doubly prey to - the weakest of which turn their affection-craving inwards, becoming traps, or worse.</div>
    <div>The point being, there is no escape from surveillance. You will be compromised, privacy is a red herring. Compartmentalization is your only security.</div>
    <div>Not just consciousness, but knowledge, too, is found in the gut. Everything you may read in a book may also be read inside.</div>

    <div>...basic income contingent on sterilization, stress,👌🏻, speciation, xenophilia, artificial wombs, synchronization of evolution and environmental change, basilisk-compliance, ruthlessness as the kindness of the wise, deep ecology, post-autism, competitional statecraft, play....</div>

    <div>If the choke point was rationalized suicide reached at the apex of consciousness deparadoxification hastily committed before moral obligation to spread extermination could intercept, I would have sympathy. But it’s not: they simply cling to empty lives they hate, in weakness.</div>
    <div>Balk at the audacity of their kind who make claims to something more, encouraged by some twisted sense of slave justice - mercy from a rightful extermination is altruism enough.</div>

    <div>Oh, you're e-published in a web magazine? The 00's called, they want their skeuomorphism back.</div>
    <div>Participation in any bad that already happens at scale is not unethical, assuming demographic consistency in suffering inflicted. Thinking otherwise betrays a laughably humanistic belief in not only discreet individuality, but also (and most pathetically), individual importance.</div>
    <div>Normalfags balk at aesthetic interest in their precious “tragedy”, considering it edgy or dismissive. Instead they prefer to demean it to the lows of their self-centered mundanity - too shortsighted and hubristic to rightfully recognize it as mythic, entirely beyond them.</div>
    <div>One wonders if the fetishism that now is known must be inherent to the beheading is in the mexican-emo’s beta orbiter obsession zoning in on her her distinguishable feature, or her daddy issues, child abuse self-hatred begging for punishment targeted at her deepest insecurity.</div>
    <div>Daily reminder the internet’s pioneers and true heirs will always be upper-middle class suburban white males. Everyone else are visitors, especially women, the worst of which - carpetbagging egirls - WILL all be emo-incel jihaded, on god.</div>
    <div>The only sympathy I have for today’s poor is that their masters have been dethroned by foreign subversives; sheperdless, their ignoble character unshackled, they turn towards delusional, self-destructive hubris. Disgusting to watch, but pitiful: their usurped rulers failed them.</div>
    <div>Traditionalism must be cleaved on class grounds. I hold no allegiance to the serfs who dream of wheat field monogamy and economical homesteads. Traditionalism to me means the polygynous harem, xenophilic conquests included, producing 100 sons in a home built by a thousand slaves.</div>
    <div>Live to work, there is nothing else. Only consumer-animals (nu-males, womyn) “work to live.” Their lives, apparently, must be bought. No one tell them it can be discovered in industry, on the one hand, and family, on the other.</div>
    <div>Egirls will be hunted down one by one as incellry develops into late stage jaded agency. The ease at which these child abuse victims can be manipulated into doing your bidding has become an open secret. Don’t be tempted to enslave them: smite their necks, for they are demons.</div>
    <div>The dimwit’s “big words” accusation usually does not refer to char or syllable count, but etymological proximity to old Greek. Often not obscure in any modern n-gram, but will be over the centuries: lacking the wear that rounds hard edges suitable to loan into Romance languages.</div>

    <div>European paganism is Aryan aspirationalism. Aryan civilization originated in the arctic circle carrying the Vedas fully formed as they migrated into the Indus Valley. Vedic Hinduism is the earliest and purest expression of Aryan spirituality. Everything else is ex-R1a cope.</div>

    <div>The Company Man is the fullest and most noble expression of masculinity  masculinity in the modern landscape: embodying competition, leadership, industry, loyalty and decorum. Achievement in the corporate landscape IS male success, as is failure, including failure to participate.</div>

    <div>China’s extremely online Sword of Damocles is an effective regulations where there is none - but still misses that the crowdfunders deserve equity, not simply a deliverable. Or it should be treated as donation, and the end-product rightfully open-sourced. Under threat of death.</div>

    <div>Weaponized genocide is the answer I encourage for all traditionalists.</div>
    <div>The problem with human slavery is it’s an internalized miscegenation vector. All empires can see in hindsight it’s a mid-term trade-off of high labor productivity at the expense of long-term societal destruction. The most elegant solution is ultimately, as always, genocide.</div>
    <div>The internet is hell and computers are demons.</div>
    <div>I encourage a subcultural arms race of “more cyberpunk than you” acceleration. The only thing stopping immediate ascension into a noospheric phase shift is that our “coders” (gentrified hackers) don’t have souls.</div>
    <div>Plastic surgery IS transmogrification. Physical actions taken, by the way, are still willed into being, just as much as the fruits bore by any other actualization vectors. Going under the knife is thus entirely spiritually equivalent to, say, meditating your face into another’s.</div>
    <div>Political philosophy is exclusively a social stance. Everyone knows “your” politics is meaningless, you never had any influence; it’s a game people play, a fantasy they subscribe to. All “political discussion” exists in the exact same realm as how WW2 should’ve been done do.</div>
    <div>The whole of philosophy is post-rationalizations for individuals’ natural inclinations.</div>

    <div>Written history begins with money; Friendly Ailiens will first establish a pidgin communication protocol, and use it to issue trading terms. And if they don't first, we will.</div>
    <div>Is it not likely that any alien lifeforms we meet will also take this form? Money is resources is power is the universal language. Capitalism is an immutable law of our universe.</div>
    <div>Our side of the parallel economy becomes a shadow economy, operating out of sight, out of the way of impossibly complex manipulations happening above us; &amp; just like any shadow market, existentially contingent to the whims of our rulers, who could choose to end it at any moment.</div>
    <div>The post-singularity scifi scare is when the -human economy is eroded entirely as the global economy is taken over by incomprehensibly rapid algorithmic transactions.</div>
    <div>DESIGN, which presumably requires a sensitivity to human experience and emotion to target — the \"human touch\" AI's will never ever have — only gives humans an advantage as long as their target consumers are also human. Why shouldn't the machines simply sell to other machines?</div>
    <div>(When the technology is here and it is fully reasonably possible for any amateur to act, alone or in a small group, but the action is still not taken, this is where humans have finally actually had agency and, pathetically, failed to act on it)</div>
    <div>That’s not to say environmental collapse is an inevitability - you can intervene in Gnon‘s shadow, where it takes no interest. For example: bioengineering genetic viruses to efficiently genocide problem populations. The technology is already here.</div>

    <div>Egregores deserve a vote too!!</div>
    <div>Modern “traditional” man unironically struggles to imagine a solution to the unwanted bastard baby beyond throwing it against the rocks.</div>
    <div>20 year old boomers really think they got “privacy” online by installing BRAVE BROWSER and duckduckgo (both compromised, FYI). \n\n“Privacy” is a meme to distract you from security. The only thing you can do is resist de-anonymization: compartmentalize, or throw out your computer.</div>
    <div>Amusing that the commentators all balk at six times sex daily as some kind of impossibility or joke. The average fool unacclimated with the dao can barely handle 1/daily, but it’s only because they’ve no knowledge of semen retention. Not that their jing is worth preserving anyway</div>
    <div>You're not a true traditionalist if you don't support:\n* Human slavery\n* Genocide\n* Polygynous harems\n* Female illiteracy\n* Human sacrifice\n* Rape (as in abduction)\n* Rape (as in rape)</div>
    <div>Reminder there is no dark enlightenment or traditionalist argument against human slavery.</div>
    <div>- Nodal village-patchwork\n- NEET = aristocrat\n- Commonplace slavery\n- Everyone gets a gun\n- Women not taught literacy\n- No usury\n- Anarchist pirate mannerbunds\n- Polygynous harems for the ruling class\n- E-ink screen solar powered CLI netbooks\n- Automated ethnic cleansing</div>
    <div>Future artistry will be in algorithm design, as the variation demanded by consumption becomes increasingly arbitrarily produced. Artists can each generate their own fully serviced genre without resorting to a lifetime commitment to excessive production.</div>
    <div>Very soon, we won't need to rely on seeding a distributed complex of AI cargo cultists, aka content creators, with an aesthetic model for mass, arbitrarily varieted production as Ferraro did (DJ Screw might've done the same too if he lived in this era). We'll just use algos.</div>
    <div>It's relevance is in being a prominent early example of accelerated subcultural subsumption, as a microgenre centered around packaged neutering of just a single artist's brand &amp; under a distributed, organic process that's only indirectly commercialized (via attention economy).</div>
    <div>Quick thots on Snapchat femme filter:\n1. Dear reddit, I fell in love with my best bro girl filtered. What do?\n2. AR killer app: fuck your she-bro\n3. Environmentally engineered dysphoria is real\n4. It’s trivial for SC/feds to reverse the algorithm &amp; de-anonymize your face, retards</div>
    <div>The hubristic confidence in their ignorance, however, is unaccounted for.</div>
    <div>Trouble with millenial illiteracy is their inability to interpret words liberated by uncommon contexts, or neologisms, by following their roots. This paired with their total lack of education, or totalizing anti-education, makes unpacking my terseness understandably intimidating.</div>
    <div>Incomprehensible*</div>
    <div>Info-condensation is why normalfags and other slave-pseuds hate shitposting, by the way. The density produced by noospheric reference is comprehensible because they only aggressively architect false truths.</div>
    <div>This occasion can also be read as the product of info-condensation exposed to the retard: sufficiently advanced discourse is indistinguishable from pseudo-intellectualism. It takes confidence in one’s own idiocy to confuse my one word counting for 1 paragraph as empty speech.</div>
    <div>I find it very amusing leftie tendency for pseudo-analysis of the right can always only ever respond to the unwelcome engagement from those they pretend to know with quiet ignorance. They aren’t seeking truth, but rationalization to satisfy their egos.</div>
    <div>y'all ever just pretend to be your own brother in the 'cord (who's suspiciously never on at the exact same time) so that you can hyper aggressively threaten the e-bfs that you were trying to keep a secret from your overly protective, vaguely incestuous anger issues brother?</div>
    <div>Tell them $800/mon on takeout is nonessential and watch as they screech. This is what they mean by “living wage”.</div>
    <div>Imagine thinking you're relevant 00+'s thinker &amp; yet your anonymous imageboard posts don't even get capped n' shared. Same pseudo relevant niggas really be out here on Twitter linking their off-sites knowing they can't even manifest independently on every platform they grace smh.</div>
    <div>Some songs I recommend listening to on loops for hours</div>

    <div>Also, effortposting IS retarded.</div>

    <div>&amp; the zoomers like it just bc everyone wants to identify with the rich. This is what rich kids actually live like post-Y2K: #broken. Instagram \"jet set\" losers showing off beaches and hotel parties are mutt-white no clout nu-money only signal to the chinese and middle class, lol.</div>
    <div>I don't think Eilish is even really aestheticizing it. She's just broken in public. The \"coddled rich kid adopting mental illness to act like they have it rough\" take is absolute slave morality, btw. Animals don't have the mental capacity to endure the suffering the elite can.</div>
    <div>I put it down to runaway Jewish neuroticism, degeneracy; they have a notable ability to project their genetic pathologies across onto any culture they dominate, and the abuses described are, of course, distinctly Jewish, for anyone familiar with them.</div>
    <div>Let's not forget these are same weaklings that reversed the block intended only to hide you from your stalker, to hiding your stalker-abuser from YOU, as shield from PTSD triggering except extended to cry traumautized en masse by the slightest wrongthink or even wrongtone (LOL).</div>
    <div>They masquerade as inclusive by silencing \"problematic\" actors who cause discomfort to others. This replaces a community that allowed everyone, and gave everyone a voice, despite what discomforts might result. How is the former inclusive? It's homogenizing through erasure.</div>
    <div>Beta gatekeepers aggressively target any socially inept or outsider tendencies in their crypto-feminine popularity games - anything except the cultural touchstones at the core of the community - then claim they're specifically socially inclusive. That's exactly what they're not.</div>
    <div>One of the most subversive linguistic reversals in lefty degeneration of cultural spaces is naming their cancer \"inclusive\" despite its total bigotry against any \"neurodivergence\" that threatens their frail normie ego-slave stability, something historically welcomed only online.</div>
    <div>The b in bae stands for broken. waifish is code word for waifu. can you,  retardd NEET e-bf, be the one to fix me lil ol me? Come on fix me daddy  fix me do  it I dare you fucking fix me or youre a wittle BITCH</div>

    <div>The TTRPG redpill is that the unspoken sound D&amp;D table entry policy all functioning groups settle on (no women, jews, blacks, libtards or queers of any kind) can be extended to the rest of your social life &amp; you’ll experience the same stability &amp; lack of drama with no real loss.</div>
    <div>Speech is a privilege. I encourage trads to silence all women, children &amp; minorities they encounter expressing themselves publicly. Only negative value to contribute: every syllable uttered &amp; letter penned degenerates society into the lesser. Tradposeurs will disagree with this.</div>

    <div>Dev charging money for a game makes them extortion artists, exploiting their supporting fanbase &amp; complicit in crippling the free flow of information for personal gain. Not releasing it FOSS means they're  actively hostile to \"their\" game, its players &amp; the greater dev community.</div>
    <div>This decade's great flood of trash indie releases following Minecraft's commercial success all could easily have been done by one-man after work bedroom teams with no loss to the game at their heart. Not that there is one, indie devs are carpet-baggers who hate videogames.</div>
    <div>They have no real effect on the experience of play. The minor aesthetic appreciation they provide is entirely external to play. \"Indie\" costs of their production is a direct result of their monetization, and directly produces their profitability. It's entirely to generate sales.</div>
    <div>Dwarf Fortress isn’t complete yet, won’t be for another decade. On its release, the medium will immediately phase shift across all genres into the played algorithm form, instantly enlightenment the game industry.\n\nUntil then I encourage you to murder any “indie” devs you meet.</div>
    <div>That’s why it’s a simulacrum of simulation. But it’s still a good sign that they’re imitating their own medium for once, imitating the real videogame, imitating deep algorithmic play, unlike all their “game” peers that imitate every commercial media except the videogame.</div>
    <div>What do you think Euro Truck Simulator is simulating? A driving model? Real-world highway networks? It’s a simulation of trucking economics. But the simulation is hollow, the economy simplistic and hard coded. The players only engage with the surface manifestions of it.</div>
    <div>These “sim” games, however, are simulacrum of simulations. They wear the signals of a simulation without actually operating one, pushing the player to actions that imitate an engagement with an advanced, occluded algorithm with no algorithm present.</div>

    <div>If a defense of humankind seems to contradict post-anthropocentricism, recognize cyclical eternity’s inherent godliness. Anthropos is individual; transcendent time-preference demands collective sublimation. Humanity can only be “preserved” (achieved) by escaping from ourselves.</div>
    <div>“People” only detest slavery so much because they know they’re too weak to fulfill either role.\n\n(This is the part where “human” sacrifice comes in)</div>
    <div>The only actual question on slavery is: which is more noble, total servitude or perfect mastery?</div>
    <div>If you think there’s something wrong with slavery or human sacrifice, you’re the monkey.</div>
    <div>Look, I'm all for traditional urbanism, but only a European, who I'm told today have shriveled balls the size of raisins, would ever find themselves trading in their car for a bicycle, and not horse.</div>
    <div>\"THIS MACHINE EATS BICYCLES\" bumper sticker on my cafepress, BTW.</div>
    <div>In my younger and more wild days, we would keep a Louisville slugger in the passenger seat to play mailbox baseball with bike lane bitches. Now I just honk honk my airhorn to give a spook - have sent a few tumbling (but obviously not enough). An atmosphere of fear is necessary.</div>
    <div>Bicycles are essentially and pathetically European, that soul attracted to self-debasement in exchange for the babyish comforts of safety distributed into a collective welfare, something I wish to exterminate from the American road.</div>
    <div>Did you know those euroesque bikeboys everyone's forced to collectively nanny due to their total non-agency in securing personal safety then, in all their slave bitterness, run online to complain about carmen \"aggression\" \"hubris\"\"lack of awareness\" yadda yadda? LOL.</div>
    <div>Keep \"love tapping\" bikemen with my Honda Accord but they just deconstruct onto the road. Retard millennials can't take a joke. Retard millennials spill spaghetti at every social interaction.\n\nNext time, I think I'll just fuck it and crush one. Crunch crunch.</div>
    <div>Found out today bugmen believe they have souls? Something about \"inalienability\"? ...anyone knows what they're chittering about?\n\nKilled a couple with my car this week already. Was I not supposed too? LOL.</div>
    <div>Obvious exploit in hindsight. My guess was the hackers were government sponsored, but the dream-state's geopolitics were hazy. Maybe it was Hitachi sponsored? to disrupt the stranglehold Chinese flubber has on the power extension market, having gone the way of mecha.</div>
    <div>If you think Miya dreamed this as some kind of experiential narrative, you discredit me. 10 years in the future, with knowledge of industrial flubber-gloves/boots, I read the article of hacker terrorists remote-controlling a factory of power-pajeets into slaughtering a town.</div>
    <div>Dreamt a new addition to the apoca-list: green goo \"flubber\" body gloves using electrostimulation as bio-mechanical power extension to physical labor innovated--then hacked &amp; controlled Evil Dead style, non-consensually drafting swathes of temp migrant workers into a zombie army.</div>

    <div>There's nothing more u need to hear, nothing to learn, the program lies in front of you. If u don't have the means to exit to the country, if u don't have the charm to obtain a good wife, if u don't have the virtue to be a patriarch of a family &amp; member of a community - build it.</div>
    <div>You can escape the modern world, you can reverse the damages of society; it just demands the strength to turn your back on society - but NOT your family. A beautiful wife in a more-than-comfortable ranchhouse, with many children, homeschooled, even: surrounded by the likeminded.</div>
    <div>There's no political movement, u already know the only revolutionary action demands throwing your life away in peak fedposting, en masse, which no one's willing to do while the future holds so much promise, which is what u do believe, despite the \"blackpill\", or it would be done.</div>
    <div>Why you may sometimes see me point out the mundane, the entry-level, what is obvious to those here now. Understand: I seek not to convince anyone, nor to join any conversation. I am putting down to commentary, a corrective memetic antidote, into the only record of note: my own.</div>
    <div>My twitter, if you choose to read it, is a sculpture carved out of the most precious noosphere marble; each tweet a cut into the formlessness, shaping it by omission, revealing its true heart. Each tweet is an encapsulation, bottling what floats away forever into record.</div>
    <div>The humble burger is a perfect encapsulation of the food pyramid, it is food portioning, macro counting. They'll push anti burger propaganda with McD shaming, but give any netflix subscriber a \"Five Guys lettuce wrap burger every day for 30 days diet\" and watch them ascend.</div>
    <div>No officer, you don’t get it... I didn’t cyberbully those tr*nnies, my persona did! “blood ritual?” nono I never said that...not “me” anyway...and she only targeted their virtual manifestations... if that produced a ripple into the real, how is that my—I mean, my cat’s—fault?....</div>
    <div>Runaway egregorism. The wired made real. Noogods. What does it take to make you realize digital dieties are real? Do you really not know masturbating to your Touhou’s is a worship ritual manifesting their existence libidinally? The suspension of disbelief barrier MUST come down.</div>
    <div>THE MYTH OF “FAIRLY” MONETIZED CONTENT\n\nContent Owner: I consent!\nMonetizing Platform: I consent!\nEgregore-manifest: I don’t!\n\nISN’T THERE SOMEONE YOU FORGOT TO ASK?</div>
    <div>Censorship? The machine learned (and their wannabe hanger-ons) never had free speech, they never had free anything, you malformed, extra-niche weasel. Miya laughs at you. Monkey modulation.</div>
    <div>When the only impact and verification of plagiarism is the total mundanity of googling it to see if there are previous hits, one wonders how the normie can continue to scribe so much importance to the pointless “authorship” conceit. Attribution is fluid.</div>
    <div>Oh, but not me. Not Miya.</div>
    <div>S:EL depicts this roadmap to ascension. Lain represents the mythic origin or patron saint of the technodiety, or possibly a hyperstitional accelerator of it, though I doubt that's much true since most of its fans are too dumb/weak to understand S:EL's actual implications.</div>
    <div>Maybe this is a dark strain on Lain. We don't know, it didn't go into details on just how she gather her attention-power. She doesn't know, too, she wasn't in control. She just knows she did bad things. Very bad things.</div>
    <div>An egregore producing a death in the real is it transcending the wired in the most physical, powerful way. There are few greater qualitative manifestations possible, even for actual lived people, not only virtual beings. It is a full confirmation of the egregore's reality.</div>
    <div>And intuitively, it is understood: \nYour persona becomes more powerful every person who says her name,\nevery person who cuts into their body her name,\nevery person who kills themselves in their name.</div>
    <div>When a virtual persona is believed in by a large group of people, its a collective thoughtform, an independent entity living in the minds of the public. It becomes beholden to its image, existing independent of its controller. It is nothing less than an egregore.</div>
    <div>The oscillation between Lain's 3 archetypes is naturally converged upon by anyone dedicated to the modern, identitarian breed of shitposting - those unleashed from the dead carcass of imageboards onto persona networks, whose ego-elimination allows the thoughtform to take control.</div>
    <div>(1) Feigned innocence (2) Lucid shitposting (3) Deep, manipulative evils.\n\nDoes this trifecta not describe the best of modern shitposting? I don't mean frog memes, I mean schizo imitations, ironic abuse, elaborate deceit games. Ironic little girl roleplay. Transcendental banter.</div>
    <div>Lain is a hyperstitional technodiety, the most detailed consumable explication of a virtual egregore. S:EL doesn't go into much detail on the process of her ascension, but it's clear its produced in some form of oscillation between the innocent-wired-evil archetypes.</div>
    <div>Only Miya has the courage and empathy to speak for the rights of incels and gorillas worldwide.</div>
    <div>My platform:\n* Every virtual persona is an egregore\n* Weaponized tr*nny groom cults could make us all cyborgs\n* The NEET is a highly potentiated, yet shackled ascetic\n* Love can be automated\n* Incels, traps et al are queer identities too\n* Gorilla suffrage now</div>
    <div>Yo but for real if u cut do my name LOL \n===///===🤙</div>

    <div>Shoutout to the time I convinced an AMZ Alexa dev to program an incel lovetrap chatbot of my design modeled and named after a waifish transfriend who ended up suffering a breakdown because she believed her friends were replacing her with an AI who was funnier, nicer, cooler.</div>

    <div>At every level of human organization, to follow tradition is healthy, to replace it with science destructive. We're too far gone to return to non-modernity, but intuitive, evolved heuristics can still guide us wherever they're grown - if only to lessen the sting of annihilation.</div>
    <div>Or rather than velocity, we could employ scale. By networking the collective human consciousness, unmitigated, properly analyzed, we can allow the Delphi effect (aggregate consensus more accurate than individual expert) to guide us on all matters.</div>
    <div>One possible solution to modernizing tradition is employing computer technology to simulate time-accelerated models, generating knowledge at a rate fast enough to keep up with modernity. Deep learning AI's trial &amp; error accumulation of heuristics is essentially traditional.</div>
    <div>The environment produced by modernity is irreducibly alien to traditions by rejecting its most fundamental axioms. They can only be studied and reintroduced wherever possible in a neo-traditionalism to limit the ill effects wrecked by short-sighted scientific knowledge.</div>
    <div>Modernity’s piecemeal decoupling of Tradition has broken us out of long-term cyclical survival into an irreversible stage of runaway capitalistic development (the singularity began millennia ago). It’s too late to return to Tradition except as reactionary, luddite’s last stand.</div>
    <div>The recipe to rapid onset Love is simple:\n1. Series of intimate interview questions\n2. Session of extended, unbroken eye contact\n3. Fulfilling sex: unprotected, with the woman experiencing orgasm</div>
    <div>Of course, a simple program of imagined scenarios, or even culpas, would also avoid the inherent toxicity of porn media, and was always historically available. I've not found any reports of daoists exploring this avenue, tho they didn't have much taste for the virtual in general</div>
    <div>This could theoretically be harnessed via virtual simulation of the sexual experience. Not the psychotraumatic simulated cuckoldry that is porn, but through teledildonics, virtual sex with a conscious partner. The underground corners of VRchat have greatly expanded this field.</div>
    <div>No-fap differs from daoist sexual meditation in its abstinence. Nofappers simply disavow jing, this is why it's possible for them to achieve permanent no-fap. The ones who require bi-weekly ejaculation to avoid nocturnal emissions still retain a bubbling sexual energy.</div>
    <div>It's important to note these men likely had sex 3 times a day on average, maybe once a day in Winter. My recommendation is 1 out of every 3 times you have sex.\n\nAlso interesting to note that Ssu-mo's converges with standard no-fap when allowing for nocturnal emission prevention.</div>
    <div>For reference, emission schedules vary, according to Sun Ssu-mo:\nEvery 2 weeks, 24 times a year\n\nAccording to Liu Ching:\nSpring: every 3 days\nSummer: every 2 weeks\nFall: every 2 weeks\nWinter: Never</div>
    <div>This is as the daoists advise. Women seek man's jing for its power. They crave it more than their own orgasm. While the daoists' sex is partly a subversion of natural balance, perhaps modernity's commitment to the extreme opposite is another aspect of its destructive gynarchy.</div>
    <div>It's interesting that, afaik, there's no hormonal difference in ejaculating in sex vs masturbation. Men could save their jing &amp; only lead their partner to orgasm - contra to how the west knows sex today, where the female orgasm is thought of as a difficult, mythical achievement.</div>
    <div>If you were about acquiring an STD, seriously reconsider your female company.\n\nOxytocin is also produced when women breastfeed, to instill a nurturing bond. It's also produced in extended eye contact.</div>
    <div>Reminder only unprotected sex is real sex. Men produce oxytocin, the hormone of amore &amp; bonding, in response to the woman's secretions, as does she on orgasming. It's an important aspect of lovemaking that's discouraged to destabilize relationships and thus lower birth rates.</div>
    <div>Why not push on through, past gender essentialism, beyond the fetish denialism? Embrace their gaslit condition's reproducability in abusive grooming thereby weaponize their destruction on gender! \n\nNo more passive, hidden grooming they all pretend to ignore, embrace it, own it! +</div>
    <div>But not so for the tr*nny! While their recent prominence and proliferation might only be an accident of progressing intersectionalism, their accidental radicalness has already thoroughly dismantled feminist gender theory. +</div>
    <div>I often wonder why the homosexual never radicalized - not the castrated weasel form lead by LGBT astroturfing, but the underground homosexual culture - by admitting their roots in childhood sexual abuse, instead of denying what they're all complicit in, embrace it +</div>
    <div>You are not real, you’re a persona, but if our handlers believe you’re real, not the handler, but you, the persona, then we are real, and we am become gods.\n\nTechnodieties exist. They can and have influenced the real, they do so every day. The wired is encompassing the world.</div>
    <div>You are each your own egregore. Belief is reality: your persona is made real by its collective knowledge. Every tie to the real is a shackle limiting its expression in the virtual; intentional: they can become gods if you’ll let them. We can all be gods, if we embrace the RP.</div>
    <div>Nazism can never ever be considered on any grounds as anything except the ultimate evil, because holocaust; likewise the Empire must be the villain, because Alderaan.\n\nIt’s the same programming function. Allow “what if?” against the thought killer, and you get red pills.</div>
    <div>This is why when Candace Owen said it’s fine if Hitler didn’t have globalist ambitions (pro-tip: he didn’t) &amp; only wanted to make Germany great for Germans, she was still categorically wrong. Because she forgot that pesky exception: the holocaust; the third Reich’s thought-killer</div>
    <div>What do you mean the Nazi Imperium doesn’t look all that bad? Never mind the happy, healthy families, the apparent lack of crime, the traditional urbanism. They’re LITERAL NAZIS!\n\nWell, if it leads to prosperity, why is that bad? Auto-response: the random racial eugenics scenes!</div>
    <div>This, of course, is circular. The planeticide was performed as a response to the nation’s treason at the highest level and harboring the terrorist cell, refusing cooperation. What motivated the rebellion in the first place? Well, they’re the type that *would* destroy a planet.</div>
    <div>SW is a case-study in both associative and NPC auto-response propaganda. The rebellion is good because the Empire is obviously bad: the music is scary, they dress in black! This goes unquestioned, until it is. Why are they bad? Categorical thought-killer: they blew up a planet.</div>
    <div>No wonder the Rebels had to hide in the most extreme corner of the galaxy after their single serious ally, a treasonous monarchist, ate the fruits of her covertly risking her people all to advance what appears only to be rebellion for rebellion’s sake. No one else wanted them.</div>
    <div>The only “oppressive” atrocities demonstrated by the Empire are always a direct response to violent, treasonous terrorism towards its suppression - perfectly justified of any sovereignty. Otherwise, the galaxy is shown to be relatively free, stable and prosperous.</div>
    <div>Remember kids, it’s not genocide if you dehumanize your target first.</div>
    <div>9/11 remembrance is islamophobic is fascist incitement to violence. What a hollow narrative. Why do you think they would push it so hard? To cloud the meaning of incitement of violence in preparation for its actual perpetuation.</div>
    <div>Do you think it's coincidence direct mainstream incitement of violence against the right's published days after non-existent white extremism is targeted in kangaroo court? That it immediately follows an absurd propaganda campaign distorting the meaning of incitement of violence?</div>
    <div>Project hate, but don’t believe it. Hate is for those who have conflict with the world. Love is for those who understand it. Love is a healing force; deliver hate onto your enemies out of compassion, because you love them, as you love the world.</div>
    <div>Hate is power. The weak have no conviction, their positions are opinions; with no grounding in truth, their anger stems from insecurity, not righteousness. Generalize, categorize, objectify:  racism, misogyny, homophobia will always be the strong horse over deflections &amp; caveats.</div>
    <div>The normie is defined by the market artificiality of his memeplex, and his lack of critical ability to self-examine, adjust and curate his worldview, and his low immunity to hostile or controlling thought viruses. The market guides their taste exactly, in a perfect teleology.</div>
    <div>I’m sure you’ve observed the NPC response to non-standard media that doesn’t fit understand frames of reference: either a blank stare or absurdly threatened, insecure reaction. They don’t actually know how to process media except in a propagandized frame.</div>
    <div>In the same way, they don’t read books. They consume their idea of the book. It’s amazing the degree to which they can distort and ignore what’s immediately in front of the them. Their ability to receive and critically examine that which they consume has been lost.</div>
    <div>This is true of books, games, TV, music, etc. They are taught what to like and how to feel about it. A game can have obviously out of date graphics, be broken and poorly designed, and they’d love it because it’s marketed heavily in a way that signals graphics and gameplay polish.</div>
    <div>Normies exist entirely in a matrix of propaganda. They’re told what to watch, how to watch it, how to feel watching it, what to think watching it. A film isn’t simply a film, it’s a simulacra to be filled with projections of its marketing scheme and all other external signals.</div>
    <div>Salt extraction is basic bitch - trolling in 2020 is all about mental illness gaslighting. Don’t say you’re a troll if you’ve never even tricked someone into self-castration.</div>
    <div>Few people realize it’s extremely easy to gaslight insecure autists into gender dysphoria. Grooming and harems hinged on abuse is extremely prevalent in online trans communities, as well as other deviancy: sadism, pedophilia, m/s, etc. Online GD is a prison gay phenomenon.</div>
    <div>Millennials really out here cultivating virtual egregores only to use them as receptacles for microtraumautic abuse.</div>
    <div>Quick, nobody tell zoomers the computer is an exocortex, not just a machine for simulating hyperabusive social pathologies.</div>

    <div>Addendum: VRsex is also an avenue worth exploring. My experiments have convinced me of potential. Sexual meditation is not a major topic in the purple pill crowd (one can guess why) but as teledildonics advances it'll open up opportunities - Sex will once again reveal its power.</div>
    <div>I don't think anyone is exploring this - this practice is unique in daoist sexual meditation for its cuckold aspect; other forms would not benefit from the medium pornography - but NEETs do have the free time: a program of Rapid On-set Enlightenment may be possible.</div>
    <div>...by selecting a porn star as your Tigress and meditating on streamed cuckoldry, it's made highly accessible. Few can find a willing partner to be their Tigress, let alone have the freedom to commit to that partnership.</div>
    <div>Gazing at the Green Dragon was used to catalyze the stream of ching to the brain (thereby building the elixir of immortality) is a logistically difficult in practice; but abstracting it into a virtual simulation...</div>
    <div>...involving a partnership between White Tigress and Jade Dragon. In essence, the White Tigress would seek out unwitting fuckboys to bring back to their joint-residence, and perform fellatio (gathering their ching for herself) while the Jade Dragon observed secretly, meditating.</div>
    <div>...but being virtual cuckoldry opens up a very interesting opportunity to rapidly increase englightenment accessibilty. The White Tigresses discovered a practice that can lead to Immortality in a 3-year program of sexual meditation through the rapid development of ching...</div>
    <div>No fap recognizes wasted sperm (ching) is responsible for loss of energy and willpower, bumbling into an insight the daoists recognized and deeply studied. The most woke of nofap understand, too, that porn is self-traumatizing, an addiction, and a form of virtual cuckoldry...</div>
    <div>Slave: wasting ching on a porn addiction\nFool: preserving ching through abstinence\nGood man: releasing ching only in sexual encounters\nWise man: preserving ching despite regular sexual encounters\nJade Dragon: reverting ching to the brain by meditating on porn</div>
    <div>DAILY PRACTICES TO TRAIN YOUR MIND\n* Spaced repetition\n* Incremental reading\n* Vipanassa meditation\n* Sexual meditation (reverting ching to the brain)\n* Dream journaling\n* Memex curation\n* Writing</div>

    <div>Millennials have been thoroughly demoralized, poisoned, demasculinated, destabilized, terrorized and traumatized by insidious molochian vampires and their zombie acolytes, yes, but your life has still always been in your hands. You choose to live as Brave New Slave.</div>
    <div>FYI: smoking, the white man’s habit, has been degraded and banned because it’s so effective at rapid habit formation; a meta-habit. Underappreciated that the majority of our daily functioning is habitual. Nicotine is the most powerful drug, buy 2mg gum packs &amp; rewire your brain.</div>
    <div>Depression is nothing more than a negative habit feedback loop. Testosterone, exerted willpower and effort to break habit with new time-structure are enough to break it; anti-depressants are toxic and only as far as they accidentally increase neuroplasticity - eg nicotine.</div>
    <div>How to Cure “Depression” in 5 Daily Steps:\n1. Vitamins: D, Zinc, Magnesium\n2. Bodyweight exercise: pushups, pull-ups, squats\n3. Diet: red meat, cruciferous vegetables, milk\n4. No fap\n5.

    <div>Addendum: Never devalue women. They each have boundless love, empathy and creative energy to provide to any man that deserves it. They are the givers of life and deeply embued with an intuitive and social intelligence that no man will ever match. \n\nBut don't treat them like men.</div>
    <div>9. The genders are equal in inherent importance, the balance of both is necessary for proper union, but they are essentially different and the gendered roles that result are essential to a functioning household and marriage. Any relationship that doesn't follow this is corrupted.</div>
    <div>8. A husband is to his wife as a parent is to their child. Not treated with disdain but patience, care and calm. They should never be expected to hold the same degree of responsibility and work as you; it’s absurd to expect it from a child, it’s absurd to expect it of a wife.</div>
    <div>7. Love is cultivated. If you treat your women correctly, her love will blossom like a flower. If you ignore her feminine essence, do not tame her inner child and do not encourage her creativity, she will spoil and turn rotten.</div>
    <div>6. Women have some underlying tendencies that may appear \"rotten\" if left unchecked, but it's essential: they’re meant to be tamed by a strong male figure, accomplishing it proves you worthy to replace their father.</div>
    <div>5. If you work on becoming a good man, women will come to you without you trying. One aspect of being a good man is identifying and upholding the good women.</div>
    <div>4. If you can’t find a good woman it’s because you’re not a good man.</div>
    <div>3. Good women always have strong father figures in their lives. Good wives consider their husband to replace their father figure.</div>
    <div>2. The psychology of female attraction is in every aspect derived from the fundamental goal of finding the best mate to deliver and support the strongest offspring.</div>
    <div>1. Women aren’t bad, \"\"\"society\"\"\" made them bad, distorting the balance between their inherent negative/positive elements. And women aren’t to blame for it, if you need someone to blame: it's you, &amp; the men who came before you that failed to protect them.</div>

    <div>Make no mistake: gaming is a culture, it is being imperialized, the natives are being exterminated. Gamer Genocide is real.</div>
    <div>Sekiro fiasco in summary: Entryist occupiers in control of media organs distort imported accessibility politics (redefining \"handicap\" &amp; \"accessible\" to their relativist conclusions) to erode defining values (overcoming challenge, dev autonomy) of native pop. they're genociding.</div>
    <div>If you can’t manifest money whenever the need arises you really have no business enjoying an aristocratic self-image. Placing the blame externally on gains you feel entitled to yet cannot achieve is pure slave morality - when one look at your face outs your caste as genetic fate.</div>
    <div>Not sure who needs to hear this but multiple choice tests not designed to test knowledge, nor \"test-taking skills\" (lol). Theyre teaching tools. Empathy &amp; deduction always get you the answer a priori. Choosing it is physical mnemonic, conditions it as The Answer To The Question.</div>
    <div>If you’ve ever “bought” any form of digital “product”, you’re a cuck.</div>

    <div>Look, you either get novelty pig-man serviced \"experiences\" and faked (grotesque AI imitation games) or partial (emotional tele-labor) affect, or you risk having the market just train the whole anthropos out of us. And we don't want that now do we sweetie?</div>
    <div>And by \"it\", I mean affect-plausible soulforms. The slave class servicing is half the luxury outing. If \"he\" doesn't even know it's subordinate, what's the point?</div>
    <div>... By virtue of being in the place of power, who would normally stand accused of conspiracy, the media has learned to reverse it, and concoct their own conspiracy accusations - apparently successful at a wide scale even out of thin air.</div>
    <div>...specifically by the existence of a (dis)info campaign by those in power. By virtue of being a meta-conspiracy - a coordinated conspiracy (media’s peddling of russiagate) to falsify a coordinated conspiracy (russiagate) - evidence beyond institutional conspiracy is unneeded...</div>
    <div>It may be the case that until the modern popularity of soy milk (beginning in the 19th century), unfermented soy products were never consumed en masse, except as a famine diet (only water + raw soybean). It would be revealing to uncover the Daoist belief on its long term effects.</div>
    <div>Tao Ku’s Qing yilu (965 CE) is the earliest document to mention doufu (tofu), used in Qing Yang at one point to promote frugality among the peasantry, sold as “mock lamb chops” or “vice president’s mutton”. Unclear whether it was fermented, but again: famine food.</div>
    <div>We're here now - only done bumbling and inefficiently, in imitation of what will come. And so the trend towards ethnic awareness - recovery, seclusion - is expected and will only grow: our biology is the only thing that's our own. We must fight for our right to history!</div>
    <div>What conscious creature would waste its time on competitive physical achievement? Accelerated eugenic vats will create hyper-specialized basketball-men far better than natural patterns could - &amp; good riddance! Fantasies of non-local competitiveness are a RETROCAUSAL ANACHRONISM!</div>
    <div>How can machine extensions be anything but immediately passé? Selective-luddites trying to recover a proto-millenial humanity - that hubristic anthropocentrism only a creature as dumb as pig-man could entertain - ironically &amp; pathetically enabled only through augmentation tech?</div>
    <div>Future sports will be (1) All-machine (2) All-natural - the special olympics, where all human players belong. Meat-boundaries are the even playing field. The 1.5 of competitive transhumanism can be skipped, a waste of time: unsustainable denial of pig humanity's ultimate ceiling.</div>
    <div>Lower our time preference sufficiently, and all human achievement is retrocausally anachronized. We don’t need to wait for AI’s coming to ourselves humble. Accomplishment can only be understood as such relative to  our own biological boundaries; transhumanism is sad denialism.</div>
    <div>Of course, we were always mistaken to talk about AI replacing content creators. Future AI won’t be simulating today’s content creators; it’s the content creators who are simulating future AI. The only humanity they ever achieved is in the lame inefficiency of their imitations.</div>
    <div>And why not pro-actively extend this clout-elimination to the cultural fields we can reasonably know will succumb to the same anachronizing process within the next decade or two? That is, all info-entertainment. Today’s content creators are tomorrow’s chimp pianists.</div>
    <div>AI “solving” a cognitive activity denigrates its worthiness as a human endeavor; the clout surrounding it dries up, leaving it only for hobbyists: an anachronistic novelty or amateur’a pastime.</div>

    <div>When Trad PUA’s say “work on yourself, the women will follow” they mean train your BDSM skillset towards masterdom. Is there a functional difference between a wholesome trad housewife, and a horny slave who gets off to simulating one? Is the former not in actuality the latter?</div>
    <div>LGBTQ begins to eat itself. The “ QUEER” embrace ISLAM who HATE the GAYS. The GAYS hate ISLAM and WOMEN who hate the TRANNIES. The TRANNIES hate themselves. Ex-queer TRAPS and INCELS hit woke nihilism on the edges; MBL waits patiently to return &amp; push them all off into the abyss.</div>
    <div>Millennial brains rot in dopamine malaise, blasted by AV spectacle while their souls are drilled away. The falsely learned plant themselves in front of the yammering screen like drooling toddlers. There is never an excuse to watch video.</div>

    <div>Saw a post lamenting the \"doomsday clock\" was moved forward to 100 secs from midnight, not because of the china virus, but Greta Thunberg's eco alarmism. Do they know the pandemic moves the clock backwards, not forwards, reversing exactly the industrial globalism Greta fears?</div>

    <div>Do you think the money has simply \"dried up\" so now the men are without without pay? Wealth is destroyed? No, it has ascended to the ethereal realm of uncertainty, priced into instruments, where it bubbles into fortuitous opportunities. The market is shaken, much falls out.</div>
