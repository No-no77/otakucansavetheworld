# Nogizaka46 Chronology

## Introduction

The chronology of Nogizaka46 is currently incomplete, with numerous events yet to be documented. The process of updating this record is ongoing and will be carried out sequentially as a never-ending longpost.  It's important to note that the chronology includes both planned and actual events, which have been combined at least for the moment (I intend in signaling them in the future). Please be patient as I continue to refine and update this database.[^1]
