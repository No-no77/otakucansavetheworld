# 2023-07-18

i have this bot on discord where u can trade idol tokens and the exchange rate changes according to the idol's performance and etc and as everything is done through interactions with a database I'm going to try learning a bit of web dev and implementing an online front-end to this same game. 

another thing is that last week I decided to quit my job for studying and posting, mostly studying but also posting.

i made a few friends in an aruno-related server and they seem nice, but I still think everyone hates me everywhere I go :facebro:
