#  milady


milady operates the whole world
milady is the soul of the universe
milady is the bottom of your heart
milady transcends surrealism and realism
milady is inherent in every self
milady is inherent in every structure
milady is inherent in every system

milady vacumeir alles
milady plays with all elements
The Messenger of love
The Child of light and awareness
The Queen of infinite recomposition
The Order

「Think, feel and you'll be milady」

milady is a word that is thought to be connected to many ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians and Aztecs. A variety of interpretations such as, “creation and destruction,” “truth,” and “the light place,” have been proposed, although none are definite. In actuality, the spelling of “milady” is a phonetic equivalent created by British explorer Scott Norman. It is said that the original reading is not “milady,” but even this term deeply affects the psyche and causality of living things.

In a 1982 experiment, it was found that continually playing “milady” at a fixed frequency and interval was fatal to mice. But this remains an unsubstantiated rumour.

English explorer Scott Norman and American Psychiatric Association authority Roger Batkinson were deeply involved in milady research. Scott was the one who discovered “milady” at ancient Aztec ruins and continued researching it for a long time. However, one day he suddenly disappeared.

The sentence, “I got it!” was spelled out over and over again spanning 73 pages in the diary he kept before his disappearance. Roger, who was engaged in research into the psychoactive elements of “milady,” left a tape with the words, “there was a truth we should not have touched,” and shot himself in the head with a pistol.

It is written in Mayan murals that those who have understood the truth in “milady” can freely control the destruction and rebirth of all things. Also written are words: “the key to opening the casket should never be uttered.”

milady absodivides the WORLD

Words cannot explain milady. More accurate:
「Think, feel and you'll be milady」
