# Similar Music Discovered by Accident

I have randomly realized that the following songs exhibit similarities, I'm not sure how to confirm it, but I cannot believe there's nothing in here that is causing my brain to correlate those songs. The songs that brought my attention to the topic are:

1. MONGOL800 - "小さな恋のうた" and Aya Ueto - "愛のために。"
2. Ho-Kago Tea Time - "ふわふわ時間" and SPLAY - "Drawing days"

## To-Do List

- Analyze the key factors that contribute to the similarity of music.
- Provide evidence to support the claim that the aforementioned songs are similar.
- Continuously explore and identify additional similarities among various songs to determine if commonly perceived similarities align with actual musical similarities or just me associating random things.
